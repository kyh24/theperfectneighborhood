Here in New York, another 345,000 people filed for unemployment  benefits, 22,000 fewer than last week. The New York State Department of  Labor has reported a 16,000 percent increase in phone calls and a nearly  900 percent increase in web traffic, compared to a typical week. The  surge of unemployment applications has overwhelmed the agency, which has  dedicated 700 people to answer phones and has said it would hire  hundreds more. Still, people seeking benefits continue to complain about  not being able to get through to the office. The agency is now  instructing New Yorkers [not to call](https://www.labor.ny.gov/home/) unless instructed to do so after filling their application online.

Yesterday I was cleaning my apartment, and she filed a noise complaint because I was walking around my apartment and the ""shuffling and thumping"" noises she heard disturbed her Zoom call.

 Broadway will have to keep its doors closed for two more months than originally planned.

In March, the Great White Way went quiet when New York Governor Andrew Cuomo banned gatherings of more than 500 people across the state due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The Broadway League announced that the shutdown would last for a month, opening back up on April 12. However, the league announced on Wednesday that the reopening date would be pushed back by two months, closing all theaters through June 7.

In a statement, League president Charlotte St. Martin said that the league‚Äôs top priority is the well-being of Broadway theatergoers, as well as[(read more.......)](https://www.ticketnews.com/2020/04/broadway-coronavirus-shutdown-extends/)",,False,0.6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/fxzlzw/broadway_coronavirus_shutdown_extends_to_june/

2qhu2,fwx1r2,My experience with a Covid funeral,"Because I'm still in disbelief that this is all happening, and I just needed a space to write where I wouldn't worry or bum out my friends anymore.

Using a throw-away because while I want to share this, I also want to protect my family.

A relative of mine passed away last week. They were Covid positive, and after spending a few days in a hospital, passed away ultimately from respiratory issues.

A very kind doctor called me, as I'm next of kin and had been handling the situation. They were very sorry for my loss and said I should wait for a phone call to get next steps.

I had read about mass funerals, temporary graves and some other scary stuff, my anxiety got the better of me and after a few hours, just started making calls myself. I didn't want my relative to be accidentally buried in a mass grave. Is that even happening anyhow?

I've had the misfortune of handling funerals before, so I knew that I needed to get in touch with a funeral home. I called one at random who didn't pick up. I then called a second that was also nearby, they picked up and could still accommodate my family.

The folks at this funeral home, as I expect others have been, are WAY inundated with deaths. The guy who has been my contact has been nothing but amazing, but has told me most who have called have been extremely stressed and rude. 

So a funeral in NYC at the time of Covid, at least with this funeral home, is as follows:

-No visiting hours

-The cemetery (at least the one we're using, not sure about all) are allowing up to ten people to gather for a burial service. But my family, since we can't really have proper services right now anyhow, have decided to postpone them until the world calms down. I'll at least show up to the burial. 

-Bodies must be double bagged when either coming from the hospital, or in the funeral home. Not sure where they double bag, but it happens. So much so that my contact said they are not allowed to dress the body or do anything to touch the body besides taking a picture, which I guess is standard.

-The coffin itself apparently must be bagged too, ""to prevent leakage"". I was warned that when the burial happens, don't be shocked to see the coffin in a bag.

I feel absolutely fortunate to have found a funeral home, and a good one at that. I feel absolutely fortunate that my relative already had a pre-paid space in a cemetery. I feel absolutely fortunate I've been able to fulfill the last wishes they gave me in regards of burial.

I have no idea how other families are dealing with this, or if they are as lucky as I am in this absolutely unlucky time.

edit: Thank you for the words of sympathy, it means a lot. Everything is so weird right now, thank you all for being kind to me with my writing.

My heart also goes out to anyone reading this who is dealing with a funeral right now. This shit sucks, and I'm cheering you on. I wish the best in these times for you and yours.

To answer a few questions:

-Cremation was not an option. I mean, it is obviously, but my family member did not want that and specifically asked for a coffin. When I found out we could still do that, I went for it. Cremation does make sense, but my goal in the past few days was to make sure I could do as much as I could per their wishes. 

-Do I think the funeral home is over-charging me for double bagging the body or bagging the coffin? Not at all. I feel like I got a really good funeral home and after seeing exactly what they are charging, I feel it's about the same as what I've seen in the past for other funerals.

-Why are they doing all the bagging? They tell me it's new city/state protocols. I'm not questioning too much, and am trying to be as patient as possible. If I'm able to fulfill my loved ones wishes with other stuff, which I have, but the coffin has to be bagged, then so be it. This place is working over-time and is still treating my family really well.

March 27th Fed Gov voted the The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, (the ‚ÄúCARES Act‚Äù) S.3548. $2200B  
**The purpose of this post is to understand what is the unemployment policy regarding the additional UI package voted in the Care Act and detailed** [**here (NY department of Labor)**](https://www.labor.ny.gov/ui/cares-act.shtm)  
**If you want to have a conversation about unemployment policy and economics I'll be more than happy but please create another thread :)**   


 I fail to understand the condition of the Care ""additional $600""

The additional $600 is suppose to start 4/5/2020 but nothing  yet. Does anyone got it already ?   
Does anyone know about the illegibility ?

2qhu2,fxyot9,Trying to file for unemployment but getting timed out? Read this before you call the number.,"I keep seeing people mention that their session was timed out and while multiple people have been trying to explain how to fix this in several comments, I think there should be a unified post for that as well. 

**IMPORTANT**: If you're getting the ""Your session has timed out"" message, it is *NOT* because the website is crashing or overused!

It is because this is a website designed for 1999 and not 2020. What that means it it isn't designed for fancy Chrome or Safari browsers. 

**If** you have a Windows desktop device, simply use Internet Explorer or Edge and the timeouts should stop. 

**If** you have a Mac, try downloading Internet Explorer and see if that works. In the likelihood that it doesn't, download Chrome *and* use the [IE Tap browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ie-tab/hehijbfgiekmjfkfjpbkbammjbdenadd?hl=en-US). This is somewhat like an emulator for Internet Explorer which you can use on Chrome. 

**If** you only have a phone and no desktop, try looking for Internet Explorer and/or emulators for Internet Explorer in your app store. But if you do have a desktop laptop or somewhere lying around, try to get to that first as those apps aren't always very good or safe.

**DO NOT** try to call the phone number if your only concern is the time out. Follow the instructions listed above. It is not the website's fault that your session is timed out, it is not because too many people are using it, it is simply because that website is too old to work with fancy modern browsers and devices. 

Also **DO NOT** try to fill it out on Safari, Chrome or Firefox unless using the IE Tap extension. You will waste hours of your time trying to beat time. 

**DO NOT** try to fill out everything really fast and that way somehow beating the system. It *may* work after a hundred attempts, but you shouldn't be racing against time. You will likely go insane while trying to do that and there is no point because even if you're really fast the system will time you out because it isn't designed for such an old website. Your best bet is simply to follow the instructions above.

Let's keep those phone lines open for those who must verify their claims. Many will only need to fill out the online application and, if used in the right browser, this doesn't have to be a difficult and painful experience.

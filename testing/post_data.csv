Welcoming suggestions or other common questions/additions.

Welcome to the year 2045. In the pandemic-ravaged dystopian hellscape of this time, the survivors of covfefid-19 scrape together a meagre existence under Our Dear Leader Mitch McTrumppel, an unholy abomination created in a secret laboratory funded by libertarian billionaires underneath the crypt of Robo-Reagan (an earlier failed experiment).

As the newest 1099 employee of UberTimeTravelEats, your job is to travel back to the year 2020 to secure a sample of the original plague and send it back to 2045. Unfortunately, the technology to send things forward in time hasn‚Äôt proved profitable yet, so you‚Äôll have to wait twenty five years to get back to the present.

To survive in the year 2020, we suggest you apply for the resource called **Unemployment Insurance.**

#Breaking News 04/09/2020:

###Gov. Cuomo's team today announced that the NY DOL UI application will go down at 5pm for maintenance. 

###See the clip explaining this [here](https://youtu.be/zvlOJKznO40?t=20m59s).

###Per the above YouTube clip here are some notable points:

* The new version of the site will launch at 7pm.
* The new application will be ""streamlined, with fewer questions"".
* Once you get to the end of the application if you successfully fill that out it is going to say you are finished with the application process.
* If you leave any information blank, the application will direct you **not** to call in. Instead, the DOL will attempt to call you within 72 hours.
* u/JosefaReports says: If you already filed a claim and need to call in to complete it, don't keep calling. According to the governor's office, anyone who has submitted a claim that's still not completed will get a phone call from a state Dept. of Labor rep within 72 hours of when the new questionnaire goes live. There's no need to refile.
* What is 72 hours?  Is that business hours?  Days? Nine?  No one knows yet.
* People ARE getting automated callbacks from the DOL notifying them that they have an incomplete claim and how to verify a DOL agent when they call! üëèüëèüëè

###[Link to the new application system.](https://unemployment.labor.ny.gov/)

###Good luck with the new application. Please report back and share your results!

#Frequently Asked Questions
***

**Where do I go to sign up for unemployment insurance?**

[Here.](https://unemployment.labor.ny.gov/)

**Help! The webpage isn't loading or is taking forever!**

Yep, that's what happens when millions of people hit a webserver. Try again in a few minutes or at another time.

**Am I eligible for UI benefits?**

Generally, if you are a full-time W2 employee who has lost your job due to no fault of your own you are eligible to receive UI benefits. Most states maintain an Unemployment Insurance Fund which is paid for in part by a small amount from everyone‚Äôs paycheck.

If you‚Äôve been laid off due to the plague, or due to lack of business because of the plague, or because your business had to close: you are eligible.

[Guide to Unemployment Insurance.] (https://www.labor.ny.gov/formsdocs/ui/TC318.3e.pdf)

**How much will I get from my UI benefits?**

It depends on how much you made before you were laid off. The maximum amount in benefits you can receive weekly is $504.

**What if I‚Äôm self-employed, a freelancer or gig employee?**

Most self-employed or 1099 employees are traditionally not eligible for Unemployment Insurance benefits. 

Under the CARES Act, championed by Democrats, NY is implementing Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) for those denied UI.

In addition, even if you are deemed not eligible for UI, it is very likely you will be eligible for Pandemic Unemployment Compensation(PUC). PUC benefits are worth $600 per week.

You do not need to apply for PUC separately. It is automatically added if you have a valid claim for UI or PUA.

**How do I file a claim if I'm self-employed, a 1099 freelancer, or a gig employee?**

[Here‚Äôs how to file a claim if you‚Äôre self-employed.](https://labor.ny.gov/ui/pdfs/self-employed-ui-guide.pdf)

Note: You will need your Schedule-C form from your most recently filed federal taxes. Your income will be determined by line 31, and you will need to upload the form at the end of the PUA application.

So get your latest tax return (2018 or 2019) handy.

**How do I know if I‚Äôm eligible for PUA?**

[Click here to find out](https://labor.ny.gov/ui/pdfs/pandemic-unemployment-assistance.pdf). 

Generally, the vast majority of folks are eligible for PUA unless you ‚Äúcan telework with pay‚Äù (which means you still have a job that you‚Äôre doing remotely) or you are ‚Äúreceiving paid sick leave or other paid leave benefits‚Äù (which means you still have a job which is paying you while you‚Äôre on leave).

More or less, if you don‚Äôt have / can‚Äôt get work because of the coronavirus, you‚Äôre eligible. [More info with a handy flowchart here.](https://labor.ny.gov/ui/cares-act.shtm)

[You want MORE information? Okay, here's the NY Department of Labor FAQ on Covid-19 UI Benefits.] (https://labor.ny.gov/ui/pdfs/ui-covid-faq.pdf)

**What if I receive W2 and have done some freelance work?**

Then you‚Äôre eligible to get regular UI benefits and PUA benefits.

**Wait, does that mean I can get up to $1104 a week?**

Yes. The CARES Act, championed by Democrats was designed this way to help folks generally replace their paycheck. Here in NY a benefit of $504 (UI benefits) + $600 ( PUC benefits) should go a long way towards paying for basic needs.

**I heard that there‚Äôs a stimulus check on the way. Is this it?**

No. The CARES Act, championed by Democrats, sets forth a separate payment of $1200 to all individuals (as well as $500 for each child) earning up to $75K. Those payments are nontaxed and are currently scheduled to start being paid out on the 13th. In order to receive this separate stimulus check, you must have filed taxes recently.

If you make more than $75K or are married (ie, you file jointly with your spouse), your stimulus check amount will be reduced progressively.

[More information on the stimulus checks are here.](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/23/21190955/stimulus-checks-from-government-approved)

**Okay, where the deuce do I sign up?**

[Here it is again!] (https://applications.labor.ny.gov/IndividualReg)

[And here are step-by-step instructions on filing.](https://www.labor.ny.gov/ui/pdfs/Unemployment-Filing-Instructions.pdf)


**OK. I filed my claim. What now?**

If you received a message from the DOL saying that you need to call to complete your claim, you need to call in. 

Otherwise, DO NOT CALL.  You're all set.

**Ok, I think I was successful but it's been a week or more and I have no idea what's going on!**

Ok, go ahead and call in. You may have filed something incorrectly or something got screwed up somewhere.

Remember: üéµ If it's been too long, who you gonna call? üéµ (The TCC, duh).

**Do I have to do anything else once the money starts coming in?**

Yes.  You have to log in every week and certify before claiming your benefits. If you have more questions, read the handbook.

**Help!111!!! I was told I need to call in to complete my claim and I'm not getting any moneyz! What the hell is this shit?**

Some folks are fortunate or may have very simple tax records that allow them to simply file online and start receiving benefits. Many of us have been told that we need to call in to complete our claim.

So yes, that means that perhaps your colleague at work may already be cashing in and drinking Quarantina Coladas, ordering Postmates, binge-watching Tiger King and Love is Blind and laughing at #PoorJennifer poop on zoom.

Meanwhile, you are stuck in the desert of Call-in-to Complete-Your-Claim.

Ergo, you‚Äôll have to brave the fires of Mordor, er, call into the Telephone Claims Center or TCC at (1-888-209-8124) to complete your claim.

* If you get a busy signal, hang up and redial.
* If you get a cheery message telling you to call back, hang up and redial.
* If you get a sad voice telling you that the TCC is experiencing a high call volume, hang up and redial.
* In fact, if you get anything but a voice telling you to press one for English and dos por Espanol, hang up and redial.

**I've been placed in a silent queue for an hour.  How long do I have to wait?**

This is a new development that started today, 04/09/20. Sometimes when you call in, you get placed into a silent queue. It is unknown if this system is properly routing calls DOL agent queues at this time. Anecdotally, it appears like this system may simply dropping callers as well.

If anyone has successfully gotten through, please share your experience by replying.

**Help! I can‚Äôt get through!!**

Yep, that‚Äôs what happens when a million poor souls cry out in agony, praying for relief.

**How do I get past this automated menu faster?**

Handy quick-start guide for navigating the automated menu:

* 1 for English
* 2 to decline calling about Extended UI
* 9 for Main Menu
* 2 to Complete Your Claim
* When prompted, enter your SSN and press 1 to confirm.  Then, enter your PIN.

**Help! I got through the automated system and put in my social security and PIN, but then my call just got dropped!!**

Yes. The telephone system is overloaded. It probably tries to put you into the queue of an agent, but it gives up and drops you when it can‚Äôt find you an open spot.

**The automated system said that there'll be a callback system.  How does that work?**

That's a new development as of today, 04/09/20. No reports of successful callbacks have been made yet. Post a reply if you have and what the process was!

**Is there a better time to call? How many times do I have to call?**

Anecdotal data seems to indicate that calling in the early AM (like right at 8AM when the lines open) has the best success rate.

Once you get into the queue, you may have to wait up to an hour or more before speaking with an agent. [You may have to call eight hundred times or more.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fvysak/oc_attempts_to_file_an_unemployment_claim_in_new/)

Good luck.

**I forgot my PIN/can't log in/made some other mistake!**

Tough shit. You‚Äôll have to call in.

**I set up direct deposit and have been claiming my benefits but I'm not getting anything. WTF?**

Apparently some folks have been mistakenly mailed a debit card instead of direct deposit. If this has happened to you, you may have to wait an additional 14 days or more to receive your card.

If your card has been mailed to the wrong address or you still have not received it within 14 days, call into the TCC.

**God! Our system is such üí©üí©üí©üí©!!!11!!**

2uqch,fymfrv,[UPDATED] HELP: Man standing outside apartment with loud speaker,"Hi there, original thread link [here for context](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/fuebgt/help_man_standing_outside_apartment_with_loud/).

**TL;DR: A man is playing a speaker with extremely loud music outside our apartment. Sister is nurse and can't sleep in anymore after late night shifts, and I can't take work calls. We are both losing our minds.**

--------

Thank you all for your help last time with this. I've followed up with all the advice that everyone gave. So far, I've:

* Emailed our councilwoman Carlina Rivera (someone responded non-committally referring us to our NCO)
* Emailed our assemblyman Harvey Epstein (just did today but no response yet)
* Called our local precinct every day once a day. Haven't been able to get into touch with the Neighborhood coordinating officer each day (out sick or unavailable).
* Have filed a couple dozen 311 requests

The police have come by maybe six times or so and asked the man to turn the music down, but a half hour after they leave, he turns the music back on.

I'm at my wits end. It's been weeks of being quarantined with this horrible music permeating every room of my unit. I've tried wearing earplugs but I can't wear earplugs the entire day, every day, including weekends. I'm losing my mind, and I don't know what to do. My sister is also reaching her breaking point, and is doing much worse than me.

2uqch,fygh69,"Family property received a summons for litter. Father's name is the one on the property deed, but he currently lives out of state. Can I go to court instead of him?","My parents bought a two family property in Queens. Their original intention was to have a place for me to stay while I finished school, and they rented out the other floor. After school was done, I moved around the city and my parents continued to rent out both floors, and they would pay a man to come and clean the property for them. Two years ago, my wife and I moved in and we started paying the mortgage amount as ""rent"". 

Since the start of COVID, the man that would clean the property ended up moving out of town. I am a paramedic, so my days have been spent mainly dealing with COVID, and I usually come home wiped out. My wife teaches remotely during the day, but because of health issues, she confines herself inside. So a week had gone by before I did any housework, just due to the volume of work I was dealing with. 

Because the house is a corner property, leaves and random garbage blow onto it constantly. A small pile of dead leaves and two garbage bags blew into he corner of our fence in front of our garage. I came home one day after a double shift, and found a summons taped to our door from the Dept of Sanitation, specifically mentioning the dead leaves and the two plastic bags. I admit I could have sucked it up after work and cleaned it, so I'm not arguing against the summons. It's just my father is approaching 80, he's still an active physician about 3 hours away out of state, and the mess isn't his fault. Is there anyway I could show up to the court date instead of him, without me having to go see him to get paperwork, and potentially expose him from stuff I was exposed to at work? If i could go to the summons instead of him, what documentation would I need to prove I'm family, even though I'm not on the deed?",,False,0.94,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/fygh69/family_property_received_a_summons_for_litter/
2uqch,fyhd1z,Resources Besides Unemployment,"Hi everyone,

Before this whole COVID-19 fiasco, I was working a full time job and a part time job, and relied on both to stay afloat financially. I've been furloughed from the part time job, and the full time job has cut my salary significantly, to the point where I'm making less than minimum wage (yes, I know this is an issue, but it's not what I'm asking about right now). I've lost half of my income.

However, because I'm still working 5 days a week I don't qualify for regular UI benefits and the two people I've spoken with at the Department of Labor say that I won't qualify for PUA either. But...I'm not making enough to pay my rent, let alone bills/food/etc.

Are there any other resources available to me right now? Thanks in advance!

2uqch,fylyfd,Ending residential apartment lease early. As tenant.,"
I signed a lease on February 2, 2020 for a term of 2 years. My landlord & I do not get along at all. It was like this since the first day. Rent was always paid on time. However, for lack of a better word my landlord is a bit crazy. She would harass me on the 1st of every month, calling me every hour asking me how long until I drop off the rent to her, etc. I cannot take the stress anymore. My landlord suggested to me that perhaps I should move. I instantly agreed. 

I am eager to vacate this place. 

My question is if I draft up a early lease termination letter that states I will vacate by May 1st 2020. Will there be any consequences if the future if we both sign it? 

Also, Should I pay for the month of April or use my security deposit as payment? Since I am going to vacate by May 1st 2020.

The department that I would be working in is one of the more stable ones, and my would-be boss has told me that the bonus is relatively stable.

I've heard that landlords use the ""Rule of 40"" when considering which applicants to consider for an apartment. Specifically, they require that your gross income divided by 40 is greater than one month's rent. Do landlords consider bonuses in this calculation, or just base? Can the rules be bent if I can demonstrate that I already have ~6 months rent as cash in a bank account?

2uqch,fxeh8z,"""Preferential rent"" v. ""rent concession"" in NYC rent stabilized apartment","Also posted in r/TenantHelp, any advice is appreciated:

 

Good afternoon,

My  girlfriend and I were just approved for a rent stabilized apartment in  Brooklyn. We did not know it was rent stabilized at the time of  application as it was not mentioned anywhere in the listing or on the  application. The building is new(ish) construction that used 421a tax  abatement benefits.

The advertised  rent was $2,800, with no mention in the listing or ""rental option""  contract we signed (with $1000 deposit) that this rent number was not  the apartment's true ""base rent.""

Management  forwarded us the lease this morning & it lists base rent as  $3608.25. There is an attached rider providing for a ""one-time  construction concession rider"" of $11,315.50 applied over 14 months,  while acknowledging the legal regulated rent is $3,608.25, leaving our  monthly obligation at $2,800.

I  know the new NY rent law limits landlords ability to raise preferential  rent rates in lease renewals. Is the use of a concession a work around  for this? Would they be able to say they want the full $3,608.25 next  year?

Also, because of the  Covid-19 situation, we have not been able to physically inspect the  apartment, but there are still provisions in the lease stating that we  did. Is there anything I can say to potentially get that altered to  reflect the reality?

I was wondering if anyone knew of good kosher grocery delivery services? On my two last grocery store trips, all the matzo was sold out. Additionally, my husband - who I love very much and am so grateful that he cooked a nice dinner for us - accidentally used our only frozen chicken, and now we have no kosher chicken to make matzo ball soup with. I know that in the grand scheme of problems right now, these are not that crucial, but I'm just a bit sad about not having matzo or matzo ball soup for Passover this year. For some reason this is the straw the broke the camel's back for me, I was carrying on as best as possible, and somehow this just drove everything home. Though I do find it a bit funny and ironic that in the Passover story, there wasn't time to make bread and that's why we had matzo, whereas this year, there wasn't time for matzo, so maybe that's why we'll have bread?

I am sure it is too late, but if anyone knows of a service that has kosher chicken and matzo and delivers to the UWS, that would be so great. Basically all the usual delivery services were out or didn't have time to deliver before Passover. 

Also, for any of my fellow Jewish New Yorkers out there, if you don't have Passover plans or in general are hoping to find shul services online, for Passover or regular everyday and shabbos davening services, feel free to DM me.

**(top-down view of our floor)**   
.............a neighbor's......|  
.............apartment.........|  
-----------------------------|  
.............|  
....our.....|  outside  
..kitchen.|  
.............|-------------------|  
(the rest of our apartment)|

...Hopefully that makes sense. So basically there's that empty space marked ""outside"", and it's not nearly as small as it looks, but there's also a building across from our kitchen as well so there's no place for most air to go but up through there, really. We've lived here for just about two years now, and for the entirety of the two years, we've had to endure smelling _very_ strong cigarette smoke coming from outside, at all hours of the day. Upon further investigation more recently (after climbing out onto the fire escape and looking down to see where the smell could be coming from), we noticed a still-burning cigarette on the windowsill of the neighbor directly underneath us. 

I read through my lease and it says nothing about smoking in the building, and I know that people are free to smoke within their own homes - I have nothing against that and I wouldn't mind under normal circumstances (smelling it every once in a while). But when I say at all hours of the day, and a strong smell, I really do mean that when we open our windows, maybe about 70% of the time, it smells like you are standing directly next to someone who is smoking, and breathing it in indefinitely. Due to the layout of our portion of the building, the air really does just flow straight up into our windows and it gives me a terrible headache at times. My boyfriend thinks we should email the landlord about it. I'm wondering if maybe we should leave a note first, and deal with it ourselves, as I'm sure the neighbor doesn't know how bad it is. Anyone have thoughts on what we could do? I mean it is truly excessive and I understand that with the quarantine, these folks shouldn't walk down the block to smoke or something, but I also think that us being trapped in here needing to breath in smoke all day isn't fair either, and they can at least step outside in front of the building, which has a private outdoor patio that will give them 6 feet of space from anyone exiting/entering the building and also from anyone walking down the sidewalk.

Making friends as an adult can be hard, especially if you‚Äôre new to the city. We are a community focused on fostering friendships for those looking for a social circle in the greater NYC Metropolitan Area. (Yes, that includes Jersey, Westchester, and Long Island.) You don‚Äôt need to live in NYC to be part of this community, however most meetups tend to take place in the city.

What is this sub for?

* Getting together with people of similar interests for the purpose of hanging out platonically.
* Exploring this amazing city through all the great shows, restaurants, museums, etc. that it has to offer.
* Finding activities to join in on if you‚Äôre bored or have free time.

What is this sub not for?

* Finding a date. If you‚Äôre looking for companionship there are other subreddits for that purpose.
* Asking about general NYC travel info. You‚Äôll probably have better luck posting in r/NYC or r/AskNYC.
* Complaining about how bored you are. There‚Äôs a reason NYC is The City That Never Sleeps. If you want to do something, consider joining an existing meetup on this subreddit or even hosting your own.

What is a meetup, exactly? A meetup is an organized event where people come together for an activity based on a shared interest. Almost anything can be a meetup as long as it‚Äôs open to the community. Examples can be as varied as karaoke nights, attending museum exhibits, or finding people to go to a movie with. Some meetups, like organizing a dinner, might have caps on the number of attendees or require you to RSVP. Others, like a beach day, might be more open-ended in terms of planning.

Some examples to clarify:

* **Blargh**: ‚ÄúAnyone doing anything tonight?‚Äù
* **Bad**: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bored, who wants to go to a museum?‚Äù
* **Better**: ‚ÄúDoes anyone want to go to the Museum of Natural History tomorrow?‚Äù
* **Best**: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm organizing a visit to the Museum of Natural History tomorrow at 3pm, let‚Äôs meet at 77th and Central Park West‚Äù

2sfn7,fov2w4,YPOW VIBE - Thirsty Thursday [Virtual] Happy Hour,"The YPOW's goal has been to connect friends and strangers, to unite and bring people together, and ultimately--to have fun.

Well, that's tough to do when you can't actually go out in this pre-apocalyptic COVID-19 pandemia, but we figured out a way.

We're using a premium Zoom subscription and leveraging the ability to breakup groups into smaller groups to create a virtual bar.

We've tested it and we're ready. Curious how it works?

\---------

5:30PM - You show up, there's a bunch of us in a big group, maybe 30, maybe 100 people, who knows. It's pandemonium!

5:40PM - We mute you scoundrels and do an opening announcement to explain what you're reading now again.

5:45PM - 7:30PM - We activate VIRTUAL INTERNET BAR ENVIRONMENT \[\[VIBE\]\].

How does VIBE work?

How does a usual happy hour work? There's a bunch of people in groups of 2-4 hanging out, chatting. You can pop around to whatever groups you want and mingle. You can also go to the bar and chat with people there.

VIBE emulates that by randomly assigning people into different groups to hang out and mingle with each other. You can join and leave freely to jump into other groups to chat with them. You can also jump into the main group (the bar room) to have a drink with a larger group of people and shoot the shit.

We're also going to setup a few rooms that people can pre-register to kickoff their happy hour with pre-selected topics of conversation / ice-breakers including:

1 - ""COVID-19 WTF"" (we may split this up into multiple groups based on popularity)

2 - Virtual Games & Video Games Meetup

3 - Virtual Volunteering

4 - St Patrick's Week Celebration

2sfn7,fm2s0z,Movie Night Through Netflix Party,"(Spiderman 3 is the chosen movie. Here's the link to the chat. [https://www.netflix.com/watch/70047101?npSessionId=6e5b0c89c515aae3&npServerId=s16](https://www.netflix.com/watch/70047101?npSessionId=6e5b0c89c515aae3&npServerId=s16)

Hello everyone. I hope everyone is staying safe and sane in Week 1 of COVID-19 quarantine. I was wondering if anyone would be interested in doing a movie night through Netflix Party. As for the movie that would be watched, I'm 100 percent open to suggestions. That said, here are the things that caught my eye that's on Netflix: Once Upon a Time in the West, Inception, The Dark Knight, Blade Runner, Batman Begins, Spiderman 3 (lol), Shawshank Redemption, Return of the King, Infinity War. I'm sure there's more I'm missing. But yeah, let me know if there's any interest! Thank you!

EDIT: (5:22 PM) - I'm thinking 9 PM as our start time.

UPDATE (6:47 PM) I'm about to form a Reddit chat, so, if anyone new comments, I'll invite you. I also wanted to say, lol, I know I have 2 votes for Blade Runner, but after some thinking - and please, forgive me- I really wanna watch Spiderman 3. I haven't seen it in full in years, and, it's fun! Versus, you know, the totally grey, dystopian, slow Blade Runner. A great movie, absolutely, but again, in the name of fun, I really want to go with Spiderman 3. If you all revolt because of this choice, of course we can pick another movie. But, if not, yay!

As for how to do Netflix Party, here's a link on how it works: [https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-03-19/how-to-have-a-netflix-party](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-03-19/how-to-have-a-netflix-party)

2sfn7,fm3yji,Any interest in a NYC Criterion Channel Film Club? (Virtual Meetup),"Hello all!

I've recently started going on a movie binge and in particular have been loving [the new Criterion Channel streaming service.](https://www.criterionchannel.com/) Great video quality, awesome selection, and most of the films have a lot of cool commentary/extra features.

The only problem is I don't have many people to discuss the films with afterwards. I was curious if any one here would be interested in starting a virtual film club? The basic idea is once a week members could all watch the same film on the Criterion Collection streaming service and then meetup via Zoom to discuss it.

There would be an emphasis on trying to cover a wide range of directors/genres/time periods and more.

This would necessitate having access to their streaming service unless you wanted rent the films individually. It's 10.99 a month of 99.99 for a year with a free 14 day trial period if you wanted to kick the wheels first.

2sfn7,fl2zwx,Thirsty Thursday - [VIRTUAL] Happy Hour!,"Heya r/nycmeetups, 

u/KarlDowden and I decided to host an event in this new world we live in.  He's in Westchester and I'm in Brooklyn, but since this is combining our friends from Westchester/NYC/BK/Qnz (and a few other places), we wanted to post here as well!  We already have over 20 people RSVP'd in under a day, so we're really glad people seem to like the idea so far!  I hope we have double that by tomorrow!

Anyway, I sincerely hope it helps bring some much-needed fun and cheer to all of you who can make it!    Check it out below and let me know what y'all think!  

\- - - - - - -  
(Quick backstory, we run a group called YPOW, Young Professionals of Westchester, but this event, in particular, is open to everyone, all ages, all professions, all geographic locations!)

YPOW's goal has been to connect friends and strangers, to unite and bring people together, and ultimately--to have fun.

Well, that's tough to do when you can't actually go out in this pre-apocalyptic COVID-19 pandemia, but we figured out a way.

We're using a premium Zoom subscription and leveraging the ability to breakup groups into smaller groups to create **a virtual bar.**

We've tested it and we're ready. Curious how it works?

\- - - - - - -

6PM - You show up, there's a bunch of us in a big group, maybe 30, maybe 100 people, who knows. It's pandemonium!

6:10PM - We mute you scoundrels and do an opening announcement to explain what you're reading now again.

6:15PM - 7:30 - We activate **VIRTUAL INTERNET BAR ENVIRONMENT** \[\[**VIBE**\]\].

How does **VIBE** work?

How does a usual happy hour work? There's a bunch of people in groups of 2-4 hanging out, chatting. You can pop around to whatever groups you want and mingle. You can also go to the bar and chat with people there.

**VIBE** emulates that by randomly assigning people into different groups to hang out and mingle with each other. You can join and leave freely to jump into other groups to chat with them. You can also jump into the main group (the bar room) to have a drink with a larger group of people and shoot the shit.

We're also going to setup a few rooms that people can pre-register to kickoff their happy hour with pre-selected topics of conversation / ice-breakers including:

1 - **""COVID-19 WTF""** (we may split this up into multiple groups based on popularity)

2 - Virtual Games & Video Games Meetup

3 - Virtual Volunteering

4 - St Patrick's Week Celebration

5 - Business & Networking

6 - Food: Rations & Quarantine-Time Recipes

We're open to suggestions for any topics you might like! All

This is open to all ages, not just us millennials, seriously. We all need some fun indoor socializing. Break out some cocktails, have a craft or Corona, or light up with us. As long as you're home and having fun, come hang out with us :)

With all the social distancing going on, and with bars and restaurants closed in NYC, it can be boring at best, and ridiculously lonely at its worst.   My friends and I are trying to maintain some social sanity by hosting a virtual social / party? / hangout this Friday at 7:30 pm.

Most of you don't know me. Some of you know me as the guy who's freakishly at Peculier Pub every Tuesday like he lives there. I won't be there next Tuesday, however.

Why, you didn't ask? Because of Covid-19, **the Weekly Happy Hour is canceled until further notice**.

This isn't going to be a long-winded announcement. We've seen enough of those from other [subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/fg65kj/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), employers, housing associations, etc. and so on. If you haven't figured out how to properly wash your hands by now I don't think a step-by-step picture guide is going to do you much good.

But there is something I want to touch on:  /r/nycmeetups is a community mostly comprised of young, healthy folk that aren't at risk of dying due to this virus. That doesn't mean we should be reckless or complacent with how we respond to it. [Flattening the curve](https://www.flattenthecurve.com/) will save lives and the sooner it's done, the more effective it will be. The easiest way that we can help is to [stop attending non-essential public gatherings](https://www.flattenthecurve.com/#DO_NOT_ATTEND_NON-ESSENTIAL_PUBLIC_GATHERINGS) (i.e. 100% of what we do here).

We're not locking down the sub. What you do with your time is entirely up to you, but I encourage all of you to heed [FlattenTheCurve.com](https://FlattenTheCurve.com) \- stay home and mitigate the spread of Covid-19. Until the threat has passed, many others and I will be on [Discord](https://discord.gg/nycmeetups) doing our part.

**Who**? Well.. *me*!  And all the rest of the Cookie Crawlers!

**What should I bring?** Please bring ziplock bags or Tupperware to keep your treats fresh through the day. Bring a backpack to store your treasures. Bring handi-wipes or hand sanitizer as deliciousness sometimes gets a little messy. And don't forget your GOOD WALKING SHOES.

**Is there a rating system?** You're welcome to rate and rank your faves but, as a courtesy to the bakeries, there will nothing handed out in any official capacity and we DO ask to keep your preferences/ratings to OUTSIDE of the bakery/cafe. (Please feel free to ask for my personal faves, though. If you show, I'll happily divulge in person!)

**Can anyone come?** ABSOLUTELY. Please feel free to invite whomever you'd like. However, for safety's sake, I will be booting people out of the Group Chat on Friday who have not confirmed their attendance.

2sfn7,fcfd5m,Corona virus precautions when meeting up [meta],"I feel like its important to remind folks of basic precautions when meeting up regarding the corona virus. The new york Times has reported the first case in nyc late yesterday.

Corona virus is not airborne. It is transmitted by droplets usually when coughing or sneezing. Health officials in the U.S. have stated not to rush to buy masks as they are ineffective against preventing the virus and may make it difficult for health service professionals to acquire enough supply.

The young, elderly and those with a history of immune issues are most at risk. The incubation period (the time which a person may have and transmit the virus before seeing symptoms) for viruses has historically been 14 days. But there is a report that one person incubated for 27 days (almost a month).

You may have the virus if you have a fever like a cold that is unusually high. Seek medical attention early to get tested and treatment.

There is currently no vaccine for the virus. There is treatment to prevent death. The virus is not predisposed to any race, gender or sexual orientation. All kinds of people have contracted it around the world.

Things to avoid:

* face/nose touching

* handshaking

* hugging

* drink sharing

* cigarette or vape sharing

Things to incorporate:

* wash hands frequently. At least 20 seconds with soap.

* apply hand sanitizer

* fistbumps

* clean your phone

If any of this is inaccurate please let me know and I will update the post.",,False,0.67,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nycmeetups/comments/fcfd5m/corona_virus_precautions_when_meeting_up_meta/

You are hereby invited to the **SECOND** ever ANNUAL NYC üç™ COOKIE CRAWL üç™!

*^(""Second???"")* ^(you muse.)

*^(""Cookie Crawl???"")* ^(you query.)  


Well, my Sweet One... let me illuminate the possibilities...

**What?** The ""Cookie Crawl"" was conceived last year to much excitement. (Look! Someone even wrote [an article](https://viewing.nyc/join-the-1st-annual-new-york-city-cookie-crawl-this-saturday/)!) It was a huge success-- a day for me, you and all of our friends to meet at some of the city's best cookie spots (as sourced by yours truly). 

Some of the places were visited last year, some of the places were missed, and some are just back by popular demand with one mission and hope: *to visit and consume their cookies!*   
\[Check out last year's [recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/nycmeetups/comments/ax10pb/recap_thank_you_cookie_crawl/)!\]  


**Why?** I ~~like~~ LOVE cookies. An obscene amount. They're my kryptonite. And I have proof from last year's crawl that there are other Cookie-Lovers on Reddit who would do anything for their next fix. So I decided to help... LET'S CRAWL!    


**How can I keep informed??** [We have a Group Chat!](https://bit.ly/2H50QJ8) Use this chat to stay informed about what's happening, where we are, and what the weather's doing. Ask questions, make friends, and countdown together!   


**Where?** We're gonna start the crawl this year uptown on the East Side at Levain, between the two 86th Street Subway stations. [Map](https://imgur.com/a/Z7gEbJX).  


*Caveat --* You don't **HAVE** to buy or eat cookies everywhere we go. Please, be as selective as you'd like! At some point, we will stop for dinner and drinks together. So save some room!  


&#x200B;

**When**? This year, the Cookie Crawl is on March 7th at 12:30pm! If we're not too large, we'll all head out together! If not, we'll take the Crawl in smaller groups and start wherever each group decides.  


&#x200B;

**Who**? Well.. *me*! Your friend, Lady!

* Lady (call me Denny or whatever you like): friendly, prone to laughter, massive cookie tooth.
* *And YOU*. (I seriously can't wait to meet you!)

Our next meeting (March 4th) we'll be watching [True Grit](https://letterboxd.com/film/true-grit-2010/) (2010, the Coen Brothers). There's always snacks and drinks.

2sfn7,f71x7d,[2/23]Spring is just around the corner! Beautiful weather (50s and sunny) for a hike this Sunday. Short train ride from Grand Central.,"This Sunday is going to be low 50's and mostly sunny, ideal conditions for a hike. 

The plan is to meet at Grand Central station at around 820 AM to catch the 845 AM train to Cold Spring (a little over an hour ride). From there we have less than a mile walk through town to reach the trailhead. 

The hike will be Bull Hill (Mt. Taurus). It‚Äôs not a rock scramble like Breakneck, just a good old-fashioned climb with several fantastic views of the Hudson Valley.

3.6 miles (Up-and-Back), approximate roundtrip time is 3 hours (but likely closer to 4 hours with breaks), total ascent of 1,350ft. 

After the hike we can grab some food at Foundry Cafe and check out some antique stores such as the charming Country Goose known for it's individually-prepared gift baskets and hard to find European items. 

We can depart from Cold Spring station on the 517 PM train and arrive back to Grand Central before 7 PM.

Hi 

I‚Äôm a 40 year old man who wants to be lead/ controlled by a female.

I would ultimately love something where we would chat daily, or wherever frequency is realistic, and I would worship you and treat you as my superior. I am a normal guy with advanced education, single, mentally very balanced and grounded, and exploring the next chapter of my life. And wanting to make an ongoing connection. 

I love the verbal aspect of degrading and I am a big proponent of controlling the mind. Deep in my psyche is an interest in having all my orgasms controlled and giving you control of my most vulnerable parts. I‚Äôm not looking to perform tasks every minute of the day but not opposed to trying things out and seeing how it goes and possibly go deeper and more intensely into it. I am very into bondage, body worship, cbt, and the mental aspects of submitting my needs to yours 

My limits are scat, blood, animals, extreme pain, blood, vomit, long standing marks

Open to a wide age range as long as female and our interests click

I‚Äôm in decent shape about 5‚Äô10, 165, busy professional type with a career, have my own place no roommates. 

Please include age, gender, ethnicity, and body type and whatever else you‚Äôd like

2tpts,foreft,40[M4F] #NYC. Any Girls Interested in Exploring their Dom Side? Bored at home and wanting to explore. Looking to explore online until this pandemic passes over and then move to in person,"Hello there,

I‚Äôm 40, fit, intelligent, established. Ivy League educated and have a leadership position in a large organization. I‚Äôm bored at home during the time of coronavirus and looking to pass the time and explore and have some mutual fun with someone - exploring things we may not normally get to explore. And hopefully have some naughty fun and then meet once Cautin passes and who knows where things could lead to :)


I have many life skills and to be honest although I‚Äôm typically dominant, I have a secret submissive side. I'm emotionally balanced and highly educated and in a phase of life where I am wanting to please and be trained to one person‚Äôs desires. In the vanilla world I‚Äôm a good cook, a great dessert maker, high EQ, photographer, film buff, have my own place, single. My work is making the world a better place. Suit kind of guy at work but intellectual/ goofball at other times.

You will certainly have your own list of interests and desires and items to try out. And I‚Äôm open to all of them. Some other things that come to mind are requiring me to do things for you, not permitting me to orgasm, or do some other tasks for you. I‚Äôm very into the idea of being put into a system of merits and demerits, and earning rewards or receiving punishments or having rewards taken away. Sure the list goes on and on‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs very mental for me but I feel the need strongly in my psyche

I‚Äôm a pretty normal and career oriented person. I envision we‚Äôd talk things out to see if there‚Äôs a connection and see if we can come up with a plan. Because of this COVID thing I'm seeking to start online and try something out and then hopefully meet once things chill out. I‚Äôm somewhat experienced with bdsm, bondage, chastity, body worship. As a side perk I‚Äôm good at massage, cooking, conversation, being a date, etc..

2tpts,flo71k,40 [M4F] #NYC - Taking applications for cabin quarantine domestic and submissive.,"I'm about to book a few weeks in a private Airbnb near on Long Island, about an hour out. I have the means, and the city doesn't appear to be returning to normalcy any time soon. So it's probably a good time to enjoy some nature, reading, music..

I'm still considering my options as far as the place, it seems I'm having to trade off washer/dryer with being close to a large park or the shore.. I'd be hiring cars for grocery trips, ordering out, and generally have the means to be comfortable.

Except for the fact that I'd be madly horny. Cue your entrance music.

Maybe you'd like an alternative to being penned up in your apartment? Maybe this just sounds like a rare opportunity to live out a servitude and use fantasy for a limited time. Typical safe word protocol, except for a bonus one meaning ""Please hire a car and send me home.""

I have pictures in my post history. I'm happy to talk and hash out details before committing to a week or more of close proximity.

Bonus points for:

\- Recent testing

\- Having been isolated already for some time

\- Domestic skills (I'm a tragic cook)

\- Being open to being photographed. (I think it might be fun to start at only fans to raise $ for mutual-aid and charity, for folks who this has hit hard.)

All are appreciated, some are not strictly required. We can arrange for testing nearby if that's necessary.

This would involve us just hanging out in pajamas eating food and binging tv cuddling and back and head rubs and light scratching also ordering food and play video games and talk and listen to music and just chill out. I‚Äôm not the biggest drinker but am pretty 420 friendly. 

About me: I‚Äôm a 20 yo guy I go to school and work a  part time retail job. I‚Äôm somewhat shy in person at the introduction but if i feel that you‚Äôre cool and genuine I open up a lot. I like to joke and kid around and at times have a childish sense of humor. I like a wide range of music, and tv shows.

As for you just between 18-40 kind, hold a decent conversation, open, and respectful of boundaries.Appearance or body size aren‚Äôt important to me because I‚Äôm not looking to hookup just platonic cuddling and convo. But being hygienic is pretty important. Oh also big plus if you‚Äôre funny and like to crack light jokes or a little nerdy. 
*And especially not sick with this whole virus going around üòÖ
If this is something that sounds cool to you lmk.

I noticed sometimes people on reddit just want to talk and not meet and that‚Äôs cool but just lmk.

Clever way to have safe fun during a pandemic","I‚Äôm 40, fit, intelligent, established. Many life skills and with secret submissive side. Emotionally balanced and highly educated and wanting to please and be trained. In the vanilla world I‚Äôm a good cook, photographer, film buff, have my own place. Ivy League educated. Suit kind of guy at work but known to be a goofball at other times. 

I recently purchased this cock and ball shocker, it attaches to the balls and administers electrical shocks at the push of a button. I‚Äôm interested in meeting a safe and dominant or dominant curious girl to explore bdsm games, perhaps several times a month. And to explore power dynamics. With you as the boss and me trained to your whims and pleasure.  

See photo of device below, it attaches comfortably and gives a shock at various intensity at the push of a button. It‚Äôs safe

https://i.imgur.com/8RIgD9N.jpg

I‚Äôm completely open to coming up with a scenario, but typically I‚Äôm into desiring things intensely but with the ultimate pleasure very hard or impossible to attain. I guess you can say I‚Äôm into intense being teased, but denied. I‚Äôm also interested in the psychological aspects of being trained through punishment and fear of punishment, or through positive reinforcement. That‚Äôs where your shocking/ training program comes in.

So I‚Äôm a pretty normal and career oriented person. I envision we‚Äôd talk things out to see if there‚Äôs a connection and see if we can come up with a plan. I‚Äôm somewhat experienced with bdsm, bondage, chastity, body worship but wanting more training and being molded to one person now. I‚Äôm good at massage, cooking, conversation, being a date, being a pleaser and orgasm giver, etc..

No one would guess this aspect of my life if they just knew me    day  to day, but I‚Äôve spent a lot of the last few years getting very    good at  reading people - learning what they like, haven‚Äôt explored due    to  taboo, and helping them push beyond that to let go.

Looking for local to NYC only, and open to couples if the chemistry is right. Physically I'm in shape ([https://imgur.com/xpCxcH9](https://imgur.com/xpCxcH9)),     hung and thick - I relish going for long sessions (to the extent   water   and snack breaks are necessary...) A few photos of me in action /   the   beginning of a few different scenes (all partners pictured have     consented to have these shared): [https://imgur.com/a/fSTY9jA](https://imgur.com/a/fSTY9jA)

Happy to provide references if there's any worry on your end - I'm respectful, playful, and very skilled at what I do.

If     this intrigues, you will write to me after reading the below and  tell    me which appeals to you. I will expect verification soon into  our    interaction, but happy to take time to chat if you‚Äôre nervous.  Zero    expectations or judgments if you get in touch.

Now, tell me what speaks to you:

A.     You look innocent. Somewhat classy, but deep inside, you have sick  twisted fantasies and it makes you wet, just knowing how filthy you     really are. How no one has a clue about it. You know you are sicker and     filthier than most girls. Message me  ‚ÄúI am dirty, Sir‚Äù if you belong    to  this category.

B. You‚Äôre a    nympho  slut. A sex-addict. A cumwhore. Even while you function and do    your  daily chores, being filled, fucked and used is the only thing  on   the  back of your mind. You pretend to be classy, but secretly  you‚Äôre a   wet  mess all fucking day. Sex is the only thing on your  mind. You  could  feel  your pussy all day long, if you wouldn‚Äôt have to  do chores.  Just  need  the right man to use you and keep you on his  leash, all day  long.   Message me  ‚ÄúBreak me, Sir‚Äù if you belong to  this category.

C.    Humiliation.  That‚Äôs what makes you cum. Being treated like trash.   Being  called  names. Spit on. Slapped. Treated like a sex object with   all  dignity  and self respect taken away. You feel guilty later on,   after  you‚Äôve  been used. After you cum. Yet within a few hours, you‚Äôre   craving  that  degradation again. Caught in the vicious cycle again and   you know   there‚Äôs no escaping now. You‚Äôll never be able to cum to a   ‚Äúnice‚Äù guy   again. Message me  ‚ÄúI am trash, Sir‚Äù if you belong to this   category.

D.   You have a Husband. A   boyfriend. A lover, yet here you are. Cumming  to  rough, degrading   writing. To women being used like shit and half  wishing  it was you.   Your partner has no idea you‚Äôre here and nor is  he kinky or  wild enough   to use you like this. You need someone to use  you like you  were made   to be used and cheating only makes this cunt  drip more.  Message me   ""Make me cheat, Sir‚Äù if you belong to this  category.

E.    You enjoy pain.  You need it to feel alive - the rush that it brings    when mixed with  pleasure sends you over the edge, again and again.    Whether this be  having your hair pulled, held down while being used; or    completely  bound, blindfolded and unaware of where and when the next    exquisite  sting will come. You need both pleasure and pain built to a    point  where you forget how much time is passing, where you can't  control    how hard your cumming. Message me ""Hurt me, Sir"" if you fall  into this    category.

F. No strong  father    figure in your life? Even when you had one, you were  neglected. Making    you attracted towards a strong father figure from an  early age. You  want   to call a guy ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù before doing everything in  your way to  please   him. That‚Äôs how you‚Äôll earn the affection you never  got.  You‚Äôre broken   now and you‚Äôve got daddy issues, but you‚Äôve  embraced  it. Message me and   say ‚ÄúYou are my daddy‚Äù if you belong to  this  category.

G.   You want to be   controlled, from what you think about to what you wear.   Tasks and   rules complete you. You want to be brainwashed. Corrupted.   Left an   addict by master until the point that you can‚Äôt say no, even   when you   want to. You act normal, but deep down inside you just want to   be an   owned, braindead sextoy. Once a good girl, now reduced to nothing   but  a  vacant look and gaping holes.

It's also possible that, rather than firing Mueller, Trump will obstruct Mueller's investigation by issuing blanket pardons of key figures being investigated, **firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein** (the person overseeing Mueller), or taking other actions to prevent the investigation from being conducted freely.

**This action would create a constitutional crisis for our country.** It would demand an immediate and unequivocal response to show that we will not tolerate abuse of power from Donald Trump.

**Our response in the hours following a power grab will dictate what happens next and whether Congress**‚Äîthe only body with the constitutional power and obligation to rein Trump in from his rampage‚Äîwill do anything to stand up to him. 

That's why we're preparing to hold **emergency ""Nobody is Above the Law"" rallies** around the country, in the event they are needed.

If actions are triggered **BEFORE 2 p.m.** local time ‚Äî> events will begin **@ 5 p.m. local time**.

Then After School Special‚Äôs GREED PLAY is the show for you! We want you for your adventurous nature, your ability and willingness to work with just about anyone, and your desire to create thoughtful and exciting theatre. 

In this demented pop-up performance we will bring together a group of daring and energetic playwrights, directors, and actors to conceive, write, rehearse and perform five short (2-8 pages) site-specific plays to be shown on the worst place in the city there is‚Ä¶. Wall Street. GREED PLAY is inspired by Theatre of the Ridiculous, Guerilla Theatre and of course John Waters, tackling the theme of corporate greed. GREED PLAY is conceived by Sean Pollock and will have Sean Pollock, Tori Lassman and Sean Morris as its Artistic Directors. 

GREED PLAY will be performed on Saturday, August 12th, at 2 and 4pm (with a possible added performance) and a rain date of Sunday, August 13th. YES we‚Äôre doing this in less than a month so prepare to pull on your assless chaps and hop on a stallion because this will be a wild one! Participating in this performance offers a fabulous chance to collaborate with new artists. A opportunity to get back in the game in an exciting way, and to explore and strengthen your craft by making quick and spontaneous decisions, subvert expectations of the patriarchy and deconstruct capitalism all in less than a month! 

IMPORTANT DATES INFORMATION: Participants must have flexibility the first two weeks of August for rehearsals. We will have an opening meeting at 7pm on Tuesday 7/25 which ALL participants MUST attend at 7pm-8pm. Directors and Writers will also have a halfway point checkin on 8/2-8/4 (times TBD). We will have a dress rehearsal on 8/10 which all must attend as well, in addition to the performance on 8/12.

HOW THE PROCESS WILL WORK: At our first all company meeting, writers will be given three prompts out of a hat and they must pick at least one to make it in the final cut of their play in addition to their designated performance location on Wall Street. There they will meet their selected director and cast as assigned by the Artistic Directors. Rehearsals will be very light and will vary depending on what each artistic team desires. We like it messy so no worries about making it perfect.

During the process, we will have one half-way point meeting for directors and writers to touch base, and then a final dress so everyone can see their pieces performed! It‚Äôs sure to be a fun process to create some awesome site specific theatre right in the heart of New York City‚Äôs financial district! While participants won‚Äôt be compensated directly, there will be a pass-the-hat option for each group!
We are looking for 5 playwrights, 5 directors, and UP TO 15 actors (or more). If you‚Äôre picked you will be put into artistic teams and perform their own corporate greed play promenade style on Wall Street! To send us your stuff, FILL OUT THIS FORM:

Moderating NYC_Resistance at the moment is like my dating life at the moment:  my two cats are the only ones keeping me company!

But in all seriousness, I'm looking for partners in crime to help moderate this subreddit.  My goals and requirements are simple:

1.  Ye shall aim high and stay there.

We're not here to engage in a war with people who voted for Trump.  Letting people express themselves, listening, and exploring options are how communities and trust is built.

2.  Ye shall be a force for peace and nonviolence.

Implicitly.

3.  Ye shall not be a jerk.

See above.

***

And that about sums it up.  I've seen some folks comment that they really like the Take Action NYC Calendar of Events.  I'd like to directly link up a calendar-bot that directly pulls from there so it's easy and obvious for people to attend and engage in protests.  I'd also like to maintain a list of retailers and stores that stock products or people affiliated with Trump, much like the GrabYourWallet folks - so that people can be educated and make an informed choice when spending their cash.  I'd love to see other ideas too!

3iu7q,5tvghk,Hi folks! - A note from a moderator.,"Hi folks.  I'm writing to let you know that I'm trying to find a time to meet and chat with the other mods and the founder of this subreddit to discuss the direction, purpose, and rules of this subreddit.

For example, I really like the idea of being able to use this subreddit as an educational and informational hub for redditors.  Like many of you all, I wasn't particularly pleased with the election results, and the first thing that came to my mind was ""How do I find my voice to protest?"".  And then, ""What do I do next?"".

I've gone ahead and set up a calendar bot that can pull information from Google Calendar, and I'd love to have it set up in such a way that we can publicize events and/or protests that people can attend.

Personally, I'm a yuge fan of exercising my opinion actively and where so many people look to - the bottom line.  I'd love to host lists of products, retailers, and merchants who either carry Trump products or support his presidency directly or by proxy.  Folks should be able to make an informed decision when they vote for a candidate in politics.  By the same token, folks should be able to make an informed decision when you spend a dollar.

Beyond the above, there's also the practical matter of moderating this subreddit.  I'd like to moderate this subreddit with an eye towards keeping discussion civil and on-topic.  I've taken the low road before in my life.  It's a life easier to live with yourself - and more importantly, with others - if you ""go high when others go low"".  I'm not here to ask Trump supporters to change any of their views, but if folks want to engage in a thoughtful and respectful way, I think they're welcome.

So if you'd like to leave thoughts, ideas, or comments, please do!  Thanks much.",,False,0.87,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYC_Resistance/comments/5tvghk/hi_folks_a_note_from_a_moderator/

From what I've gathered online, it's a duplex and the area looks pretty posh today. My relative was a railroad worker and to the best of my knowledge, their pay wasn't out of proportion to standard living wages at the time. He was 43 years old at the time he lived here, unmarried and without children.  He was the only one of the family's railroad crew (there were lots back then!) to live in the US for any period of time, though he did eventually return to Canada. 

Can anyone tell me what the neighborhood would have been like back then? Like I said, I think it looks pretty fancy today on Google Street view, but I've never intentionally visited Brooklyn. Is it?

I bought them through Ticketmaster during the 2 for 1 sale for Broadway week and the seats are Mezzanine Left, Row D seats 9&11. They are currently listed on Ticketmaster as well but if you would like to save on fees, I'm just looking to recoup the cost I paid, which is $172 for the pair. 

We could meet at the theater for the exchange as the other 4 of us are still planning on attending the show. If this is not allowed, please let me know.",,False,0.85,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYList/comments/exht7i/2_tickets_to_mean_girls_on_broadway_0204_7_pm_172/

Hi everyone, I'm currently co-leasing an apartment in Brooklyn with 2 people. To make a long  story short, I found a couple of things in my lease that were suspect and talked to some lawyers. Quick props to free legal consultation at NYC Bar Association Monday Night Law, very helpful resource but dunno if it's still available with Covid-19 situation because I visited in December and January. **I listed the issues discussed below, I'm not asking for any advice on them, just posting them because they may prove useful to someone.**

Currently we're all working, and we all managed to pay rent for April.  However that might change. Personally speaking, my hours were reduced. I'm working on a letter addressed to the landlord (via certified mail just in case) and I'm planning to ask for a rent reduction in light of the circumstances, and to open up discussions on how rent will be handled if one or more of us lose our jobs (waiving rent, etc.). We have a spotless record with rent payments and don't have complaints, which should be a good bargaining tool. If the landlord reduces our rent, then we might consider renewing our lease (which ends in August). Otherwise, we will seriously consider other apartments and he will have to deal with finding new tenants.

* A page is apparently missing from our copies of our leases, the numbered parts jump from 27 to 34. The lawyer advised us to talk to the landlord about getting a complete lease.

* A lawyer noted that the landlord could potentially return all of the security deposit to one person and would not be legally obligated to distribute it to co-leasers in equal amounts. She advised us that we should ask for the lease be include return of security deposit in equal amounts.

* The late fees for late rent are $150 or 5% (whichever is greater), and was not updated to changes applied from the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (act passed June, lease was signed in August). The late fee should not exceed $50. We are also getting invoices where this wrong amount is stated. Lawyer advised us to include in revised lease.

* Our apartment is listed as rent stabilized for year (2017) out of last 20 years on rent history from DHCR. The lawyer advised us that there is a probability our apartment is illegally de-regulated and to contact DHCR.

2sftr,ft68wo,[Listing] Room in 1 Bedroom Flex Apartment in Murray Hill / Kips Bay,"\*\*\*This is a repost with the rent lowered and the move-in date slightly adjusted\*\*\*

Hello People of Reddit!

Me and a roommate (both 23-year-old Asian males) are currently sharing a 1 bedroom flex apartment (with the living room converted into a second bedroom via temporary wall) in Murray Hill (near 34th and Park).

I am moving to California for a new job, and I am seeking a tenant who is willing to take over my share of the lease **starting May 1st** and move in with my current roommate. The new tenant will take my place in the flex bedroom in the living room through the end of July, and the lease will be assigned to him until then. My share of the rent is $1,500 (not including utilities, which are \~$75 / month). This monthly rate can be negotiated within a range. If move-in takes place during the middle of a month, the monthly rate will be pro-rated and transacted via venmo.

My roommate, who is staying in the main bedroom, works in software engineering and is quiet, respectful, and unobtrusive.

The apartment has a shared kitchen, bathroom, and small common area. The flex bedroom advertised features access to the balcony, which has an unobstructed view of the empire state building.

The building is centrally located and is within 2 blocks of the 6 subway line. Grocery stores, pharmacies, and other subway lines / major stations are less than 15 minutes away by foot. The building has 24/7 doorman services, a gym, a bike parking garage, laundry on-site, a rooftop lounge, and an elevator.

The apartment can be either furnished or unfurnished; the new tenant has the option to purchase any piece of furniture in the room (except the mattress) from me a discounted price. I will throw away whatever furniture the new tenant does not want.

For pictures, a tour (virtual or in-person), or additional details, please shoot me a PM. Even if you aren't interested, please send to anyone who might be.

Thanks all, and stay safe out there!

One block from the 6 train, super short walk to 4, 5, NQRW at Union Square. Fantastic location for the price--I've loved living there and am sad I had to get out. My misfortune works out in your favor apparently, as you get an apartment in an incredible location, with a furnished living room and expensive IKEA bed that I can't deconstruct and take home!

2sftr,fsc5wt,"[LISTING] BUSHWICK, EVERYTHING INCLUDED. MOVE IN ASAP $1200","Right by the Gates JZ station in Bushwick. Roommate is moving out at the end of March, so his room will be available April 1st for $1200/mo which includes all utilities. Looking for someone for at least 6 months.

THE ROOM

The room is rather large and features a closet and tall bay windows that face west for great afternoon light. The room comes furnished with a West Elm queen-size bed, memory foam mattress, desk and dresser with plenty of in-room storage. There is central a/c and heating.

THE APT

This place is huge! The kitchen and living room comprise the main common area, and we have access to the rooftop. We love pets, but at this time cannot accommodate any animals. We prefer not to take the party home, as all of our schedules vary wildly.

INFO

5-minute walk to the Gates JZ line, 15-minute walk to the Myrtle-Wykcoff L

There are several, excellent groceries stores in our immediate vicinity, as well as many excellent bars, restaurants, and laundromats within easy walking distance

Around the corner from a few public libraries

The apartment is just off of Broadway, but far enough down the street that it is pretty quiet

Actually fast Internet

Spacious, well-stocked kitchen with a robust set of appliances

YOU

If we're close in age and interests, I'm sure things will work out great. Other than that: Be clean. Be employed. Be solo (sorry, no couples and no pets!). Be cool.

DETAILS

Utilities and wifi are included in the rent for convenience. We require a full deposit of the first and security rent prior to move-in ($2400). No indoor smoking or vaping. Sorry, no pets, no couples.

2sftr,frxzoa,[Listing] $1225 Room for Rent in a 4 Bed/ 2 Bath Brooklyn Apartment.,"Located at Bedford/ Myrtle Ave, off the G train.

Hello Reddit! One of my roommates just had to move back home with everything going on in the world, and I would love to find someone myself and the other two roommates will get along with to take his place!

We're on the 5th floor, with an elevator straight to our apartment, we've got a dishwasher, balcony, spacious kitchen and living room, and we're all clean tidy people. You would have a room with a window, closet, dresser and bed. You'd share a full bath with one roommate, and we've got laundry literally across the street.

Best Part? NO YEAR LEASE. You have to commit to 3 months and give six weeks notice before moving out, that's it.

NOW MORE ABOUT US!

Me: Originally from the Virgin Islands, I work in film and television in a number of capacities (PA/ Cam Team/ Live Broadcast/ Editing, etc.), I love sailing, exploring, TV, videogames, and socializing! I'm a proud Hufflepuff who makes friends easily and latches on to them forever and ever. I also play guitar and would love someone I could jam with! (24, male, somewhere between straight and a-sexual)

Pan: Originally from China, works in post-production doing Motion graphics and After Effects. Clean and tidy, mostly hangs out in his room but will socialize when he's cooking and we're hanging out in the living room. (30? Male, has a very nice girlfriend who sometimes stays over on weekends, and he sometimes stays with her)

Carlos: Originally from Columbia, currently studying animation and is out of the house or doing homework most of the week. Very kind, sometimes we make pizza together, good sense of humour, we're currently watching American Vandal and Rick and Morty together (He hadn't seen either!!)(23, male, I have no clue it hasn't come up)


You: I would LOVE another extrovert in the home, or an introvert willing to be dragged to bars, comedy clubs, live music, and maybe a park to watch dogs. If you play music that's a plus, if you're a writer that's a HUGE PLUS (I've been working on a couple screenplays and occasionally make extra beer money writing coverage for people), and if you love animals that's another major plus.

I've got Hulu on the tele, and once Carlos returns from Columbia we'll hook up his Netflix. Some of my favourite shows are Avatar: TLA, The Office, Parks and Rec, Brooklyn 99, Better Call Saul, Broad City. I also have a PS4 you'd be welcome to use! Right now playing through The Witcher and replaying The Last of Us.

Oh, I also like weed and rum and would love somebody who might have a drink or smoke with me. Come be my friend!

My roommate and I need to move out of our apartment in Crown Heights, and our building has asked us to help find new tenants.

The unit is a two bedroom, one bathroom with spacious bedrooms (currently fits a king-sized bed) and floor to ceiling windows. The unit is quiet and overlooks a shared courtyard, with no street noise and quiet neighbors.

The apartment is brand new, as we've been the only tenants that have lived there. It has bluetooth speakers built into the living room, completely modern kitchen and bathroom appliances, and plenty of closet space. The apartment has central AC/heating and is equipped for FIOS internet.

The building has a shared roof deck with panoramic views of Brooklyn and Manhattan, a fully-stocked gym, laundry on each floor, package rooms for any deliveries, and a 24-7 doorman. There is a shared courtyard with garden space and an entertainment room with pool and televisions. The building is pet friendly and has a veterinarian on the same block.

A brand-new luxury grocery store just opened on the first floor of the building, and the neighborhood is full of fantastic restaurants and bars all up and down Franklin Avenue. You're a short walk away from the C train on Franklin, and a few blocks from the 2/3/4/5 express lines on Eastern Parkway.

We've loved living here and will be sad to leave. We have some furniture that we'd be happy to sell to the new tenant.

I have two main questions + some background for clarification. Apologies in advance for the long post but I hope you guys can help! 

My boyfriend and I are moving to NYC from Atlanta, GA in July (barring any horrifically drawn-out coronavirus circumstances). We will be Masters degree graduates (in May) in our early-mid-twenties seeking full-time employment. We want to live in Brooklyn and have done lots of research into the history and cultures of its various neighborhoods - we‚Äôre stoked! :) 

We were both born and raised in suburban Atlanta. Up until now we have been privileged to live under our parents‚Äô finances, and have either lived at home or had apartments rented for us by our parents during our studies. 

How truly necessary or beneficial is it to have a previous landlord‚Äôs letter of recommendation to rent an apartment in Brooklyn? We simply don‚Äôt know whether or not we‚Äôve established the sort of rapport with landlords such that it would be appropriate to ask for a personal recommendation. Furthermore, many of the places we‚Äôve lived have been student housing facilities that are managed by the university and don‚Äôt have the necessary figureheads. 

Is there another financial asset we can leverage in place of a recommendation letter? Or what else should we expect if we submit a leasing application without one? 

My second question: Since we are out of state and are in school until May, we believe it will be difficult to secure jobs before our move (although naturally we will apply vigorously and see what comes). But in the case that we are unsuccessful in getting remote (as in hired BEFORE we formally move there) job offers, what should we expect as far as renting an apartment with no current employment? We have savings worked out to cover 4-5 months of rent within our budget + utilities and possible brokerage fees, among other moving costs. Would a bank statement detailing account balances enough to cover several months rent in advance be convincing to a landlord in lieu of active income documents? We also have our tax documents from previous years, but we made so little money because we only worked part-time jobs while we were students. 

If anyone has any general advice for people in our circumstances, we‚Äôd love to hear whatever you have to say that might help us have a smoother transition to becoming New Yorkers.

I'm hoping for a tidy, quiet roommate with a stable employment status. This is a non-smoking building; I don't care if you smoke, but you just have to go outside to do so. A love of board games, bicycling, or progressive politics would make for a pleasant match.

I am a manager of software development at a cybersecurity firm, working remotely from home. I like a clean, modern aesthetic in decorating. In the evening you can find me out playing competitive pinball.

2sftr,fq355x,"[LISTING] APRIL 1ST MOVE-IN, FURNISHED & UTILITIES INCLUDED, 6MO LEASE","Right by the Gates JZ station in Bushwick. Roommate is moving out at the end of March, so his room will be available April 1st for $1200/mo which includes all utilities. Looking for someone for at least 6 months.

THE ROOM

The room is rather large and features a closet and tall bay windows that face west for great afternoon light. The room comes furnished with a West Elm queen-size bed, memory foam mattress, desk and dresser with plenty of in-room storage. There is central a/c and heating.

THE APT

This place is huge! The kitchen and living room comprise the main common area, and we have access to the rooftop. We love pets, but at this time cannot accommodate any animals. We prefer not to take the party home, as all of our schedules vary wildly.

INFO

5-minute walk to the Gates JZ line, 15-minute walk to the Myrtle-Wykcoff L

There are several, excellent groceries stores in our immediate vicinity, as well as many excellent bars, restaurants, and laundromats within easy walking distance

Around the corner from a few public libraries

The apartment is just off of Broadway, but far enough down the street that it is pretty quiet

Actually fast Internet

Spacious, well-stocked kitchen with a robust set of appliances

YOU

If we're close in age and interests, I'm sure things will work out great. Other than that: Be clean. Be employed. Be solo (sorry, no couples and no pets!). Be cool.

DETAILS

Utilities and wifi are included in the rent for convenience. We require a full deposit of the first and last month's rent prior to move-in ($2400). No indoor smoking or vaping. Sorry, no pets, no couples.

We moved in back in March last year and we are renewing our lease for another year. Unfortunately our awesome roommate is moving out to live with his girlfriend so we're looking for someone to renew with us. move in dates are flexible so you can move in April 1 or up until mid April but dates and proration could be discussed in person depending on what works best for you. Our landlord will require an application with proof of income and a credit check. You'll need a 700+ credit score or a guarantor. Rent is $950+ utilities and first and last are required to move in.

So now to tell you about us! My names is Andy and my partners name is Jimmi, we've been together for 4+ years, originally from Portland Oregon and moved to NYC in January of last year with our two chill kitties. We both have jobs. I'm a line cook and Jimmi works as a barrista. We enjoy video games, cooking, film and chillaxing from NYC's fast pace. We seldom party unless theres a rad event that is a must.

Looking for a cleanly roommate that is chill, enjoys hanging on occasion and has similar interests and is open to having scheduled weekly chores to keep the space nice for friends, hang outs and such. (We can switch out chore goals and thats something we can discuss as a unit later).You also must be LGBTQ+ friendly.",,False,0.5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/fp0nbl/room_share_1_bed_in_2br_in_bayridge_move_in_april/

I'm a 27 year old male who works full time in fashion marketing (currently, I am working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic). I live in Sunset Park right now, and am partial to the idea of moving to either Park Slope or Carroll Gardens, but am open to other areas of Brooklyn or Manhattan for the right situation. Gay friendly. 

My move in date is flexible, and I can potentially up my budget slightly. 

I like to read, watch movies, and go on walks, and under normal circumstances I enjoy going to art galleries and museums as well. Personality-wise, I am friendly but also low-key and introverted. I enjoy good conversation, but at the end of the day when I come home, it's super important for me to have quiet time to unwind. Given what is happening in the world right now and the likelihood that we both may be working from home, consideration for the other person's space and comfort is extra important. 

I do not smoke and do no have any pets. I clean up after myself and would like my future roommate to do the same.

2sftr,fo87t7,[listing] [room share] Room available ASAP in Crown Heights 3BR - approx. $815/mo,"Hi folks!

I have been living in a room in this 3BR apartment for nearly four years now. I'm moving in with my partner or else I'd never leave it. It is available starting April 1.

My roommates are looking to replace me with someone as long term as possible. Preference for someone who can sign a one-year lease with them.

Room is 11.5 x 11.5, current rent is $808 but may go up slightly (landlord has always been willing to negotiate in the past, and I imagine current realities will make him even more so).

Jon and Samm are both great roommates and people in general--one is a community organizer/activist (is not his day job) and the other is a social entrepreneur (is one of his day jobs). Two affectionate, sweet cats round out the home. They are mama and son and they do cute things together like snuggle and clean each other's faces.

Usually, both roommates are out almost all day and are mostly just home to sleep. At this time, Jon is working from home (but keeps pretty quiet). Samm still leaves for work but comes home to study (also quiet).

Someone who is conscientious and a bit friendly (but understands boundaries) will fit in great here.

I am not taking my bed with me, so if you want it, it's yours for free. Full size with a platform and \~6"" legs.

No couples, please.

No additional pets, please. Sonnet and Saint Francis own this place.

Me and a roommate (both 23-year-old Asian males) are currently sharing a 1 bedroom flex apartment (with the living room converted into a second bedroom via temporary wall) in Murray Hill (near 34th and Park).

I am moving to California ASAP for a new job, and I am seeking a tenant who is willing to take over my share of the lease and move in with my current roommate. The new tenant will take my place in the flex bedroom in the living room through the end of July, and the lease will be assigned to him until then. My share of the rent is $1,875 (not including utilities, which are \~$75 / month). This monthly rate can be negotiated within a range. If move-in takes place during the middle of a month, the monthly rate will be pro-rated and transacted via venmo.

My roommate, who is staying in the main bedroom, works in software engineering and is quiet, respectful, and unobtrusive.

The apartment has a shared kitchen, bathroom, and small common area. The flex bedroom advertised features access to the balcony, which has an unobstructed view of the empire state building.

The building is centrally located and is within 2 blocks of the 6 subway line. Grocery stores, pharmacies, and other subway lines / major stations are less than 15 minutes away by foot. The building has 24/7 doorman services, a gym, a bike parking garage, laundry on-site, a rooftop lounge, and an elevator.

The apartment can be either furnished or unfurnished; the new tenant has the option to purchase any piece of furniture in the room (except the mattress) from me a discounted price. I will throw away whatever furniture the new tenant does not want.

For pictures, a tour (virtual or in-person), or additional details, please shoot me a PM. Even if you aren't interested, please send to anyone who might be.

Thanks all, and stay safe out there!

Restaurants and Bars are all closing their doors in light of the Corona Virus and my roomies just found out today that they will not have any more shifts until this whole thing blows over.

I cant, in good conscience, kick them out during a time like this, but I also can't float the entire rent myself and I'm not in a good financial position after ConEdison slammed me with $1000 in back charges last month (adjusted bills) which I paid in full and the roomies agreed to reimburse via several installments.

Now I'm wonder what the hell I'm going to do about rent coming up in 2 weeks.

The roommates have some savings but it's not enough and it'll take 3 weeks for unemployment to kick in. I told them to hold off on reimbursing me for utilities for the time being until we figure out what to do.
They're talking to family to see if they can get some financial help, but what else can we/I do?

I know evictions are temporarily frozen, but if we can't pay rent in full, will the landlord just kick us all out in a month or two and would I then be fucked in terms of ever finding housing in NYC again?

This is one of TF Cornerstone's properties and I am looking for 2 potential roommates to live with. It is a 2bd/2ba that is flexed to a 3bd/2ba unit. 

Net Prices (PER ROOM):  
Master bedroom: $1920  
Second bedroom: $1640  
Flex bedroom: $1640 (I am taking this one)

Here are some of the amenities:  
24-Hour Doorman  
Lobby Lounge  
Fitness Center  
Basketball Court  
Yoga Room  
Open Kitchen  
Peloton Bikes  
Outdoor Terrace  
Parking onsite

Walking distance to:  
Subway lines: 1, 7, C, B, D, N, Q, R, W  
Bus lines: M11, M12, M31

There is a promotion for moving in currently, so the price is 14 months for the price of 12 months. Meaning that price will slightly jump after the 14 month contract (i.e. 1640 -> 1767; 1920 -> 2068). Also amenities have an annual fee, but will be waived for the first 12 months. This will add \~$50/person after the 12 months. 

This unit also has a washer/drier in the unit. See photos for the two rooms. DM for more info. Thanks!

2see4,ft2fsx,"[Hiring] Software Engineer - Taptap Send ¬∑ New York, NY","__About Us__

Taptap Send is an app that lets immigrants send money back home to Africa instantly and at very low prices. Since launching in summer 2018, we‚Äôve already moved tens of millions of dollars and reached tens of thousands of customers. We‚Äôre live in seven European countries, and we support payments into Senegal, Mali, Zambia, Ghana and the Ivory Coast, with more countries launching soon.

Global remittances account for over $500 billion annually, most of which moves back into developing countries. But the market is dominated by traditional services that are expensive, can take days to arrive, and have limited reach in rural areas. We're helping people to send that money instantly and securely at a fraction of the cost. In doing so, we are working on making the UN Sustainable Development Goal of bringing cross-border remittance costs down to 3% by 2030 a reality today.

Taptap Send is a venture-backed start-up with investors including Reid Hoffman, the Omidyar Network, and the Global Innovation Fund. We pride ourselves on hiring exceptional talent -- our team members come from a wide variety of top-tier tech companies, professional services firms, and industry leaders, including Twitter, Yahoo, Uber, Amazon, McKinsey, Bain & Co, Deloitte, KPMG, Cravath, and Vodafone.

To continue our rapid growth, we're looking to bring on people who are passionate about our mission and excited to work in a small startup environment. We have competitive salary and stock options and great benefits, and we were recently rated one of the best companies to escape to by Escape the City's 'Escape 100'.

__The Role__

As a Software Engineer, you'd help define, build, and iterate on Taptap Send. We‚Äôre excited to grow the team in order to tackle our upcoming challenges, which include scaling up to handle increased volume, improving UI and UX to drive growth and retention, handling increasingly sophisticated fraud attacks, building tools for our customer support and acquisition efforts, and much more.

We‚Äôre looking to add to the team across the stack. We don‚Äôt require familiarity with our technologies, but our app is written in React Native; our backend services are built in Kotlin; PostgreSQL is our main datastore; and we run on AWS, using Docker, Terraform, and Ansible to manage our infrastructure.

In addition to producing the reports, the Director of Technology will be responsible for analyzing the data and flagging concerns to executive and managerial staff.

The Director of Technology will also be responsible for creating audit reports and processes to ensure that organizational data is up-to-date and accurate and that operational tasks across the organization are being completed in a timely manner by all staff (i.e., invoices are being submitted to clients and nonprofits, etc.).

In America, we‚Äôve promised that hard work and ambition will be met with equality of opportunity. The reality is that we have a quiet crisis on our hands. Despite 1.2 million low-income or first-generation students enrolling in college each year, only one in four will attain a strong first job or enroll in graduate school upon graduating.

In partnership with universities and employers, the Braven Accelerator empowers promising young people on their path to college graduation, meaningful careers, and lives of impact. Alongside educational institutions, Braven provides a scalable model to discover, develop, and connect extraordinary, diverse, and driven young people to high-quality skill building, opportunities, and networks. From the Accelerator will come a generation of leaders as diverse as our future demands.

To date, 69% of Braven‚Äôs Fellows have landed a strong job or quality outcome within 6 months of graduation, as compared with the average of 54% for all students nationally. Braven Fellows outpace their peers in internship attainment, non-cognitive skill growth, and college persistence. Braven currently operates in Newark, NJ, Chicago, IL, and San Jose, CA, and is launching in New York City. We aim to become the nation‚Äôs leading accelerator of diverse talent, putting 100,000 emerging leaders on the pathway to college completion and economic mobility. Our work is highly data-driven around the outcomes of college graduation; workforce readiness skills-based proficiency; employment in a high impact role within six months of graduation.

We believe Braven is a solution and we are on a mission to scale it, equalizing access to the American Dream.

__The Role:__

Braven is seeking a Manager of Software Engineering (Front-End) to join us in building online experiences, tools, and services to help diverse undergraduate students get strong first jobs after graduation. This role reports to the Chief Technology Officer. You will manage a team of software engineers focused on the user experience to have a real impact on students‚Äô lives. We want students using our platform to feel empowered, connected, and engaged. To accomplish this, we aggressively prioritize which projects we work on, aiming to provide the most value in the simplest way possible. We constantly iterate to improve our services as we see what works and what doesn‚Äôt. We‚Äôre agile and we like to have fun!

You will play a crucial role in our mission: staying knowledgeable about relevant technologies, developing engineers on your team, helping peers grow through code reviews, identifying weak areas of our architecture and prioritizing accordingly, and leading the technical design of new systems. Braven is entering an exciting growth phase in which we need to balance agility to develop new features against discipline to ensure we use software engineering best practices. We have projects that span the spectrum of software engineering: feature development within existing products, prototypes for new product discovery, data warehousing/ETL systems, and learning devops technologies to help us deploy/test/troubleshoot faster.

To be successful at Braven, on the Tech Team, and in this role, you must demonstrate Braven‚Äôs core values, step forward as an engineering leader, be comfortable with ambiguity and constant evolution, and welcome constant feedback and learning.

I received a call from (646)-257-2276, when I googled the number, The Bluebell Cafe in NYC came up however that isn‚Äôt their current phone number.
I proceeded to call the number back & no answer. I went to look at all the applications I submitted & I didn‚Äôt find an application submitted for this company at all. I assumed maybe the position was under a different business name, maybe for payroll purposes so I waited for another call or email. 
The next morning, I received another call at 9am and the caller with an heavy accent said ‚ÄúI have call from you.‚Äù I said yes I received a call yesterday from this number. She proceeded to say, ‚Äúoh yes (my name) you applied for a server position (never stated where) & are you still interested.‚Äù I said yes. She then said that ‚Äùthe position could pay up to $17/hr, requiring serving and running a food buffet line.‚Äù She asked if I had my food handlers certificate in the state of NY and I told her no. She said ok, it is required to have this license in order to work. & ‚Äùare you willing to pay $80 to obtain this?‚Äù I said yes. She asked if I would be able to work in Manhattan (again never stated the exact location) I said yes. She proceeded to tell me to meet for an interview at ‚Äúone of their locations‚Äù which was 30 Broad ST, 14th Floor. To tell the lobby that I was here to go to the 14th & once I got to the 14th Floor, to say I was there for SF America & ask for DIELLA. 
I had a feeling it was a scam from the first call because I never applied for this company that the phone number was linked to on google and also that company did not have any opening ads anywhere for hiring. Once I received the call, I was excited since I am looking for work but once I received the email which is EXACTLY THE SAME as those posted on here, I started to research and found many people going through this same predicament. Please be aware, this is still going on months later! Sick sick people!

The Division of Anthropology seeks a DBA & Software Developer to carry on the work laid out over the past 25 years in which our programmer developed our Collections Management System. The system consists of the Archaeological and Ethnographic Collections at its core and includes components for Biological Anthropology, Conservation, Archives, Integrated Management, Image Management and Thesaurus Management. Some components are in a SQL Windows/SQL Base system on a Windows 2012 server and some are browser-based components developed using ColdFusion and MySQL also on a Windows 2012 server. The Division‚Äôs website has also been developed and managed by the programmer and includes a public facing component of the database.

The Division is currently in the process of migrating and consolidating the Collections Management Database with the help of a consulting company that is providing the new software on the LAPM platform.

__Position Summary__

This position will maintain the current mixed environment system for a short time while the systems are migrated to the new platform. Once migration is completed duties will include the customization and maintenance of the new system, configuration of web and database servers, backup and tuning of database, and management of user privileges.

The developer will maintain and expand functionality of the Collections Management Database (including Biological Anthropology, Conservation, Integrated Management, Image Management and Thesaurus Management Systems); will maintain, upgrade and enhance the Division‚Äôs website (http://anthro.amnh.org/); will collaborate with other cultural institutions in sharing collection data through the web.

The developer will assist the Division staff and Web users in working with information systems.

The developer will be responsible for overseeing migration of the existing systems from Client/Server architecture (SQLWindows/SQLBase and ColdFusion) to the LAMP platform, working closely with the consulting company providing the new software. Both Windows and Linux server knowledge are necessary for this transition as the new systems will be Linux based (Cent OS) while the old system is Windows based (Windows Server 2012).

__About Quill__

Quill.org is a free online tool that helps low-income 3rd-12th grade students become great writers. Quill.org uses natural language processing to automatically grade and serve feedback on student writing, enabling students to continually revise their work and quickly improve their skills. Quill.org has enabled more than two million students to write and receive feedback on more than 300 million sentences, and we aim to help ten million low-income students become strong writers and critical thinkers in the next five years.

Our pedagogy is based on years of research that shows that once a student understands the logic behind constructing sentences, his or her ability to read and write improves dramatically. Unlike common multiple-choice-based learning tools, our tools allow students to write directly in their browser and receive real-time, teacher-quality feedback. If you're interested in learning more about how these strategies benefit students, Peg Tyre, an education journalist and Quill board member, has detailed the power of these strategies in this Atlantic piece.

- We were named one of Fast Company‚Äôs Top 10 Most Innovative Education Companies in 2018: bit.ly/2G7IExb

Instagram: https://instagram.com/postergirlmarketing?igshid=fik38vbxfu0y

I saw that they were hiring on LinkedIn and applied. I got called in for an interview, but between their Instagram, the interview location, the actual office location and the website I‚Äôm not really sure what to make of it.

Things that make me suspicious:

1) They mentioned what pay might look like in the invitation to interview. They also mentioned a commission component that wouldn‚Äôt really make sense for the position I applied for.

2) Their Instagram only has 37 posts from mid 2019 until now. It also seems full of ads for other small businesses, not really like its advertising its own projects, capabilities and successes. Just seems very weirdly out together, especially for a business that claims to have been together since 2004 and with a team of 6 professionals. But they do tag other seemingly legitimate pages and interact with posters.

3) Website seems pretty trash for 15 years old also none of the people pictured on the website are ever featured on the Instagram nor can I find results for anyone but the founder when I google them. And their LinkedIn uses the exact same picture which seems a bit odd to me.

4) The biggest oddity though is that despite claiming to have a location at 25 14th street in Manhattan, I got invited to a group interview in Brownsville (don‚Äôt want to give out the address PM me if you‚Äôd like to confirm something), google maps shows this as residential home. Furthermore despite the strange choice of interview location, they asked me to call them upon arrival. The number they gave is listed as their office number on both google (which lists their 14th street address) and in the invitation email. That said the position I applied for isn‚Äôt really one that lends itself to group interviews so that‚Äôs weird enough on its own. 

It‚Äôs a bit hard for me to make heads or tails of what‚Äôs going on here. I‚Äôve spent more time than I probably should have trying to figure it out, but I get the feeling that either this place is a front for lining people up or it‚Äôs just a **really** badly run agency. My money would be on the former. I‚Äôm not going to the interview but I figured I‚Äôd post this up just in case it could help anyone else out or if someone had some information to clarify what‚Äôs going on here. Let me know if I can elucidate anything further.

2see4,f6uz8c,[For Hire] We will fix WordPress speed issues for you.,"Hello guys,

After fixing lots of WordPress speed issues for clients, we have decided to offer a good deal for you.

As we all know, website speed matters. A lot. It doesn't only affect the SEO, but also affect the Conversion Rate. However, WordPress is known as a slow website platform because of its huge and complex capabilities.

Here we come. Me and my team focus on optimizing WordPress websites for better load times. Here is the full list of things will be done for you:

* Full Website Backup
* Page & Browser Cache
* CDN Setup and Configuration
* Minifying JS/CSS/HTML files
* Lazy Load Images
* GZIP File Compression
* Image Optimization (Unlimited)
* Woocommerce Optimization
* Database Optimization
* 404 Check & Fix (All)
* Disable Heartbeat
* Deferring Unused JS/CSS
* Inline & Combine JS/CSS
* PHP Version Update
* Blocking Harmful Crawlers
* Font Optimization
* Cache Preloading
* Server CPU Optimization
* Image Hotlink Protection
* Hosting Migration

**WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT?**

We are a hardworking, prepared team, so we start your project on the same day! Our work can take up to 7 days.

Increased speed is 100% guaranteed with us. If your website cannot reach the promised speed, we fully refund your payment.

**FAQs**

**How does your 2X speed guarantee work?**

If your website cannot become at least 2 times faster, we pay you back. No gimmicks. No word games. No excuses.

**How can you guarantee a speed increase?**

Our team is very strong on WordPress, this let us find most of the potential performance issues and fix the problems that lead to slow loading. We trust we can speed up most of the WordPress websites, so we can guarantee.

**What if something breaks during the process?**

You will not see any breaks since we have a strong testing policy on our team. We test your website both on desktop & mobile after each small change to see if something got broken. If something got broken, we fix it in a few minutes.

**Do you work on the live website?**

Since speed optimizations and tests should be checked on the live website, we work on live websites. By working on live websites, we are enabled to test your website after each of our tasks to see if something got broken or not. However, if you would like us to work on your development or staging environment ‚Äî no problem, we work on it too.

**How do you check site speed?**

We use various tools to see potential improvement areas. We mostly use GTmetrix and Pingdom, since they are the best tools ‚Äî they do speed tests like real users. We are focused on exact speed increase, not the scores that other tools give.

**Do you use Google Pagespeed Insights?**

Yes, we use it to find areas to improve. However, it doesn't actually measure site speed. It checks your site against a checklist of technical best practices. It's actually possible to get a very high score in Pagespeed Insights, 90/100 or above, and still, have a very slow loading site. Pagespeed Insights also completely ignores critically important elements like geographic location, DNS hosting speed and reliability, content delivery networks and often spits out a bunch of recommendations that at best are marginal speed improvements and at worst a complete waste of time. GTmetrix and Pingdom are way better than Google Pagespeed Insights for speed measurement.

**What information do you need to optimize my site speed?**

33me2,fxceve,Questions on Subway station density & placement,"It should be noted that I'm not from NYC but this is my perspective as a resident of the SF Bay Area which has a much lower overall population density.

To start, lower Manhattan looks too dense with 14/18/23/28/34 Sts on the (1) having their station exits a 4-5 minute walk away from each other at most. I'm assuming the succession made sense with the original shorter IRT platform lengths and lower population density at the time of construction, but if that were the case, why not close 18 St as was done with its Lex Av counterpart during platform extensions? Was it rather that the Lex Av 18 St had to be closed because of the offset platforms at Union Square?

Crosstown access seems like a pain in the ass with the (G) being the only rail service; I presume it's made worse by only having 4-car trains and some awkward station spacing. Would the section between Broadway and 21 St have benefitted from having 2 or 3 more stations?

As for the Second Avenue Subway: only 3 stations between 63 and 96 Sts and no express services in the high-density Upper East Side? ^I'm ^aware ^of ^the ^construction ^cost ^but ^that ^just ^seems ^like ^its ^own ^massive ^problem 

My overall perception is that stations should be set up such that each one by foot would be somewhere around a 7 to 12 minute walk away from each other depending on locale/population density; is this a valid viewpoint or an oversimplification?

And more general questions: 

* **What works and what doesn't about current NYC Subway station spacing?**

* **If given the opportunity, what would you change about station placement assuming overall alignment can't be altered?** This can be at any scale, from adding/removing individual exits to redoing the system with the same ROWs",,False,0.91,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/nycrail/comments/fxceve/questions_on_subway_station_density_placement/

Now we only have Kawasaki of Japan and Alstom left to bid on future orders, right?

Here's where two newer players could possibly enter the ring:

CRRC is a rolling stock manufacturer from China, and they have been gaining orders in other parts of the world, most notably for building the CTA 7000 series for Chicago, and the HR4000 for LA Metrorail in California.

EDIT: Turns our CRRC was banned from bidding, so we're just talking about Stadler here

Stadler is a Swiss company that has been around since 1942, but has only been making rolling stock for metro systems in the last decade or so. They recently obtained a foothold in the US with an order to manufacture new CQ400 railcars for MARTA in Atlanta.

**Artist Name** - I know it is not always easy to know who is responsible for work on the street, but include this information if at all possible.  Artists usually sign their work somewhere if you just take 2 seconds to take a closer look.

**Location** - Any contextual info on the neighborhood or cross streets.  This is helpful for those who want to go see the work in person, as well as highlighting spots that have new work popping up on a regular basis.  

**Year** - this is only really applicable if you are posting an old photo.  Current images do not need this info.

Here are some good examples:

* New Foxx Face mural at Welling Court
* Buff Monster / Williamsburg / 2012

In general, original content is *greatly* preferred.  There are plenty of places on the internet to look at aggregated photos of street art.  For now, this is not mandatory, but I think OC submissions will be a huge benefit to the quality of this sub.

2y84b,6nyrmj,Want to be involved in some street theatre on Wall Street?,"Are you a whore for politics? A maniac for disorder? A John Waters glutton? Or just a total freak? Then After School Special‚Äôs GREED PLAY is the show for you! We want you for your adventurous nature, your ability and willingness to work with just about anyone, and your desire to create thoughtful and exciting theatre.
In this demented pop-up performance we will bring together a group of daring and energetic playwrights, directors, and actors to conceive, write, rehearse and perform five short (2-8 pages) site-specific plays to be shown on the worst place in the city there is‚Ä¶. Wall Street. GREED PLAY is inspired by Theatre of the Ridiculous, Guerilla Theatre and of course John Waters, tackling the theme of corporate greed. GREED PLAY is conceived by Sean Pollock and will have Sean Pollock, Tori Lassman and Sean Morris as its Artistic Directors.
GREED PLAY will be performed on Saturday, August 12th, at 2 and 4pm (with a possible added performance) and a rain date of Sunday, August 13th. YES we‚Äôre doing this in less than a month so prepare to pull on your assless chaps and hop on a stallion because this will be a wild one! Participating in this performance offers a fabulous chance to collaborate with new artists. A opportunity to get back in the game in an exciting way, and to explore and strengthen your craft by making quick and spontaneous decisions, subvert expectations of the patriarchy and deconstruct capitalism all in less than a month!
IMPORTANT DATES INFORMATION: Participants must have flexibility the first two weeks of August for rehearsals. We will have an opening meeting at 7pm on Tuesday 7/25 which ALL participants MUST attend at 7pm-8pm. Directors and Writers will also have a halfway point checkin on 8/2-8/4 (times TBD). We will have a dress rehearsal on 8/10 which all must attend as well, in addition to the performance on 8/12.
HOW THE PROCESS WILL WORK: At our first all company meeting, writers will be given three prompts out of a hat and they must pick at least one to make it in the final cut of their play in addition to their designated performance location on Wall Street. There they will meet their selected director and cast as assigned by the Artistic Directors. Rehearsals will be very light and will vary depending on what each artistic team desires. We like it messy so no worries about making it perfect.
During the process, we will have one half-way point meeting for directors and writers to touch base, and then a final dress so everyone can see their pieces performed! It‚Äôs sure to be a fun process to create some awesome site specific theatre right in the heart of New York City‚Äôs financial district! While participants won‚Äôt be compensated directly, there will be a pass-the-hat option for each group! We are looking for 5 playwrights, 5 directors, and UP TO 15 actors (or more). If you‚Äôre picked you will be put into artistic teams and perform their own corporate greed play promenade style on Wall Street!

My friend and I built this app because we noticed that a lot of walls around us change, and the changes are not cataloged or there is no history of the art that used to live around us. So we wanted to build something that could solve this problem, while at the same time, respect the community's need by not exposing the exact locations of the art. We called it Relic - we'd love to know what you think of the name or if you have other suggestions too! This is definitely a work in progress

We have a beta app(iPhone only at the moment) available for folks interested in the idea of preserving art on the streets. If you'd like to try out our app, just PM us your email and we'll send you an invite rightaway. Some highlights:

* The app lets you capture photos and videos of art around you. The captured art is then available for others to view on the app, if they are nearby

* The app does not show exact locations of the art. It does not let you navigate to art, nor put the art on a map (there is no map). The app also doesn't identify an artist

* Any art visible on the app implies that the art is near you, approximately 1 city block near you in any direction

* When you sign up we request for your email, to know that you're a real user so that we dont have bots signing up on our app. We dont share your email with anyone else, neither do we plan to send you any emails.

The app is still a blank slate of possibilities - we really want to know if this is a worthy tool for the community and we'd continue adding features that the community thinks can be helpful. The app is not available on the app store. Since its in Beta, we have to manually add users using their email. Eventually if you guys think this is a great tool we could release it to the store

Hope to have many of you try it out and tell us what you think!

First off, hope this kind of post allowed - if not mods please feel free to delete.

My friend runs a ""mom and pop managed"" brewery in Bushwick area. He built it up from scratch, and is using unorthodox brewing equipment to make some quality pints.

He's looking to get the shutter door spray painted in exchange for a growler/beers. You'd pretty much have all the artistic freedom as you want, it would just need to say the name of the brewery on there.

I know I'm not the only one who is terrified to hear that we have 12 years to essentially reverse climate change before we're all even more screwed over. In 12 years I'll be 30 - which is terrifying even without the prospect of an apocalypse. In the interest of not just signing online petitions and recycling more, I am considering starting a meetup group focused on zero waste/environmentally conscious living. As of right now I have some pretty vague ideas that I would definitely need to flesh out more before starting any kind of concrete meetup (and also before paying meetup's monthly fee).

Some of those ideas include:

\- trash pickup

\- making zero waste products together as a group

\- volunteering for local environmental organizations

\- clothing swaps

\- I was thinking that the first meetup could be in January so we could discuss ideas and make resolutions for a ""green 2019"". 

Obviously I am young and idealistic so I want to know if anyone else would actually be interested in joining this? I figure it's pretty dumb to start paying for a meetup group that nobody would be into. 

I hope it's ok that I posted this here. Thanks in advance for any responses (including constructive criticism). ",,False,1.0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nycvegan/comments/a3eb1w/gauging_interest_for_starting_a_zero/

The flavors I tried (Choc Chip Cookie Dough & Peanut Butter Choc Chip) were both delicious. They had a really nice salty sweetness to them, and were both really creamy - perfect ice cream texture.

I'm happy that there's at least still *someone* serving vegan ice cream on the lower east side, even though I wish they were all vegan.

We had:

* Sunchoke, Olive, Pistachio, and Quince Toast
* Beet Salad with Kumquats and Horseradish
* Potato Cannelloni with Pine Nut Ricotta and Eggplant
* Cauliflower, Spinach, and Oyster Mushrooms
* Chestnut Farro Risotto with Acorn Squash
* Cinnamon Rice Pudding

If I had to pick, I think I liked the Cauliflower best - but honestly every single thing we tried was amazing.

I loved that the menu was totally vegetable focussed (even though I love seitan, tempeh, tofu etc.) And the staff were all lovely and knowledgeable. 

It was expensive, but I'd say it's totally worth the price. I'd put Avant Garden up there in the top tier of U.S. vegan restaurants ‚Äì i.e. Millennium, Vedge, Candle 79, Hangawi.

The only real downside is that the space itself is a little small, so it can feel a bit cramped in there, especially considering how popular it is.

2tlia,fh4vcv,Structural Safety of NYC Subway?,"Is anyone able to provide any insight on the structural safety of the NYC subway? 

I had what was for me a traumatic experience on the subway - a train I was on stopped abruptly in the middle of a tunnel, they shut off the lights and air due to a track fire ahead of us that we could see from the first car window. We were told the air was turned off so as not to ventilate smoke into the cars while we sat in the dark just waiting for what ended up being about 45 minutes. Everything was fine ultimately, but following this incident, I have become very nervous on the subway in general, but particularly when trains slow down or stop in a tunnel. Unfortunately, this happens a lot in NYC, and it's well known that the subway here has not been properly maintained in the last decade. 

I'd be interested in learning any facts relating to the structural safety of the subway - how much of a concern is any kind of ceiling collapse, how much danger does a track fire present? Is it dangerous to be stuck in a tunnel? What if a train stops in an underwater tunnel, or there is a water breach? I guess I'm looking to check my anxiety against reality, to the extent folks out here may be personally familiar with the NYC subway, or are engineers who have knowledge of how it was built and how it is maintained.",,False,1.0,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Subways/comments/fh4vcv/structural_safety_of_nyc_subway/

I understand that Hunter is a BA in CS, which leaves out some math and other programming classes(?). I assume they put more of an emphasis on liberal arts stuff.

City is a BS, which goes to Calc 3 and also requires a year long science sequence(?).

Trying to weigh the alleged advantages of the City program against the convenience of Hunter. Context: I work full time while studying full time, so time saved for sleep etc carries extra weight. The commute to City would be an hour plus minus, versus half an hour to Hunter.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE - APRIL 7**

As COVID-19 keeps the entire city inside, and a face mask is required to gain entry to the corner bodega... I've had some time to consider this decision.

I'm planning on committing to Hunter. It was a tough call, because I enjoy the mathematical aspects of CS/programming as a whole, and I know that City leans more in that direction. Considering taking a minor in math or stat at Hunter, depending on how that would impact overall timeline.

With that said, I like to think of myself as a self starter, and I spend the majority of free time reading, studying, learning (aside from school related activities). Therefore, I feel comfortable compensating for any Hunter drawbacks or program weaknesses on my own time.

The more material that goes onto blackboard, the more you can rely on it for test preparation if you feel you have to skip class.

&#x200B;

Every campus has Blackboard, and every campus has even more online resources than that. If your prof has NOTHING on blackboard then start demanding that material be put up, they can not claim that their material is proprietary or that it can't go onto blackboard, the campus has a contract with blackboard and each individual course section has it. It's really important to do this now ESPECIALLY if your prof has put nothing up, because sometimes the section needs to be \*activated\* by IT at the profs request, and that can take a long time if the prof doesn't know what they're doing.

&#x200B;

Also, CUNY does not drop students for failure to attend and attendance isn't actually even supposed to figure into your grade. Most profs attempt to get around this by saying 'participation' is 5--10% of your grade, but in normal times that can be fought. (As a separate issue, your federal aid and be denied if you \*never\* showed up and you can be dropped, that's what confirmation of attendance is used for, not for grades though).

Right now with campus closures looming, students should be able to stop showing up to lecture-only classes and work off of online materials. You need to bring these issues up RIGHT NOW and not at the end of the semester when some wacky professor tries to fail you for this stuff.

1.) delivery.com $13 off a order of $15 or more. This one works on food, groceries or alcohol. The link is my referral code but I also recommend creating two accounts for yourself with two seperate emails and referring yourself, this way you get $13 off twice. I made $52 doing this trick. Just make sure you don't use the same debit/credit card twice. Link: https://www.delivery.com/share?code=kwatkins4


2.) $15 off first uber ride. Same idea as above to get double the savings. Link: https://www.uber.com/invite/kelseyw1389ue


3.) lyft $5 off your first 10 rides. Code: LYFTMENOT10X5


4.) $12 off your first seamless order of $20+. Code: zesty12


5.) get a free NYC ID and get these benefits at museums/zoos. This one ends December 31st of this year! Link: http://www1.nyc.gov/site/idnyc/benefits/benefits.page


6.) fresh direct grocery delivery $50 off your first order of $125+ with this referral link: http://refer.freshdirect.com/v2/share/6297958293256096650


7.) peapod grocery service- $20 off your first order and 60 days free delivery with code 60DAYSFREE

8.) Amazon fresh grocery service- 30 day trial with $30 off first order with code FRESHOFFER. This I like less because you're required to sign up and then cancel your subscription after 30 days to prevent automatic payed renewal

I'm currently in Houston, so cost of living is going to greatly increase and I get that.  My biggest issue is that there is no relocation assistance from this new company which is causing logistical stress.

The plan is for me to work from here over the next 2 months at a lower pay rate (cost of living being less here), and then relocate myself to NYC towards the end of October or early November.  When I do that I will be rolling up there with my RV as a place to live, but that means I'm going to end up fairly far from the city in order to find a place to put it.  

I'm really have no idea about NYC's layout, or the areas where costs go up or down.  I'm gambling that coming up in my house on wheels will still end up cheaper than having to get a place to live in the city.  Especially since my lease here in Houston doesn't end until Jan 1, and I won't have the money to buy myself out of that so I have to ride it out at the same time.

I have someone I can stay with in western CT, but google tells me it would be a 2.5 hour train ride into the city one way to get to work.  I am not sure how sustainable that distance will be, but it's the only way I can think of to keep costs down while riding out my TX commitments.

What are some other tricks you can tell a person who's never come through the city other than passing through and a 1 week work trip there that was all expense paid, 15 years ago... ? :) those are my only experiences with the city previous.

**TL;DR: Completely new to the NYC area, but having to relocate there in late autumn, while managing TX lease on an apartment until Jan 1.  I have an RV, but no idea how to make this financially do-able while I transition.  Any NY help/tips/tricks are appreciated.**

I would prefer doing or observing/learning something while staying dry and warm: games, board games, exhibits. Watching a movie might be all right, but $14 for a (not so great) movie?! Whaaat?

Two of us are coming from Brooklyn and one from Queens. I don't mind going into West Brooklyn (closer to manhattan side if I got that wrong) as long as the F and/or G are running (sunday schedule at nite?). It'll probably be quieter and less touristy than manhattan, I assume at least...

It might be a nice idea to start identifiying all the tracks that Kid Capri is playing here in his set. It is kinda hard and shazaming is mostly useless in this situation.

So I call upon you, my dearest cratedigging friends of the interwebs, to help me on my quest to find all the songs that this amazing DJ is playing. Thank you!",,False,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HipHopHeadsNYC/comments/fl8cvz/a_call_for_action_help_identifying_kid_capri/

2z8jb,bl0xvd,"37 minute freestyle with friends, made into an album.","Hey Guys. I previously posted a post asking what I should do. A couple months ago, I was fortunate enough to let my phone record a whole 40 minute freestyle session with all my friends in my roommates room. Me and my group of friends are in our last year of high school. Before I even started recording, we also were all clapped (high) on pens, so we all got in the mood.

To set up the vibe, it was a dark room, there was an apple home pod where my boy *Zeirong* would play the youtube type beats. There were also other friends, like *Tayo*, *James*, *Mikel*, *Andre*, *Renato* and others. While we were rapping, some were playing minecraft, but all were listening and being an engaging audience. 

The 3 not mentioned are the rappers of our group. We first had **T-Kay**,a really good freestyler from seattle. Crazy flow. Second we have **AbleAlan*. He was a boarding student from China, so his English wasn't very good, but he always freestyles with us to get better, and I honestly respect him so much, because he isn't scared to look bad, if it means he gets better. Unlike other friends that you can hear saying that they *suck at freestyling* when they've never had the courage to even try. And then there is me **flav.io** I'd like to say that I brought freestyling to my group of friends, and am always the one to start freestyles. For the most part of the freestyle, you hear me and Tariq, but Alan sometimes joins in, but it's only us three rapping throughout.

After I listened to the rap, I knew that I had to share it with you guys, so I posted the first ever ""Bodies Freestyle Album"" as well as the full 37 minute version if you guys want to listen to the whole thing.

The reason were called bodies, is because we're a huge friend group, and since we're always together, instead of saying everyones names, we just call them *Bodies* because they're so many bodies (people) in that group.

https://soundcloud.com/flavdotio/sets/bodies-freestyle-session

I think the best parts are **Little Brown Book** **Stuck in 1 moment** and **Renachins Battery**

Thank you so much for reading, I would really love any feedback or comments or thoughts.

2vcm6,fvjntq,üí•Help us with a weekly AMA/interview with experts in the local scene üí•,"This sub is based around electronic music events, and due to the pandemic, no such events are happening anymore. It seems like there isn‚Äôt much to discuss here except how much COVID has made us miss raves, and how to support those who are suffering. 

However, since many schedules have cleared up, we thought it would be a good opportunity to reach out to venues, behind the scenes folks (like lighting/sound people), and any other experts to see if they would be willing to do an interview/AMA for our community, about a certain topic they have knowledge of. We will include links to their charities/initiatives of choice to help people who work in the scene affected by COVID. This way we can all learn about topics in the local electronic music world and simultaneously help those in need!

For example, the first one I want to do is all about lighting/visuals at raves. IMO crowds aren't supposed to stare at a DJ throughout their set, so having visuals and good lighting can be essential when experiencing electronic music live. I've always wondered what the lighting/visuals guy is doing in their booth, how they prepare, and how you even get started making lights your profession. It's not something we think about often, but is crucial to the aesthetic and experience of raves since they began. I already emailed [one of my favorite lighting designers in NYC](http://kipdav.is/), and he said he's super down to chat with us! We're guna put up his post this week. 

 **I would like to do one of these every week if possible, but we'd need your help figuring out topics you' all are interested in, and reaching out to people. If you want to see more of this on the sub and want to contribute please:**

1. Propose a topic we should explore, and who you'd like to hear discuss this topic. For example *'I wanna discuss sound systems, so I'd like to hear from someone at Public Records or Nowadays'.*
2. If you know someone who would be a good candidate for these, hit them up on social media, and ask them to do an AMA for r/avesNYC
3. Please donate to their respective charity/campaign when they do post. If we can bring significant help to them, we can really show how our community can make a difference and more people will be willing to chat with us.

I jog for about 5-6 miles and it takes about an hour. It is **mind-numbing**. If I have to keep up this routine for months I am going to need some more music to listen to.

Here are my soundcloud likes: https://soundcloud.com/jaargonnyc/likes

I used to listen to this set pretty often on runs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw522HpM0gk. Love the intro track, which apparently is by M83 (!?).

The things that drop a set off the jogging rotation for me are (1) a single bad track in the middle of the mix--can't seek past the track while I'm running!--and (2) too many melancholy or abrasive tracks.

My name is Max, longtime member of the r/avesnyc community . I don't post often, but I do read, and I am always pleased to find this sub a positive, largely unpretentious place.  As a club music devotee and lover of the New York club circuit, I'm grateful for spaces like this.

With that in mind, I'm excited to share the details about a party I'm putting together this Saturday at Magick City in Greenpoint. Magick City is an intimate, independent club space with a beautiful analog sound system that rivals the best in the city. I've had some of my favorite nights out in New York in the warmth of that system, so it's a special pleasure to be doing a night of my own there.

I've invited one of my favorite DJs, Madteo, to play alongside myself and local record heads Tuggle, and Duane Island. 

If you're unfamiliar with Madteo, I highly suggest diving into his mixes - he's one of the most uninhibited DJ/producers I've ever heard, and to have him playing on Magick City's system is going to be thumping and damn good.

Here's a favorite mix of mine so you can get a feel for his sound:

2vcm6,fbvjtl,Changes at BASEMENT?,"Hi all,

I thought it would be cool to give everyone a heads up on changes I noticed at BASEMENT on Saturday, bear in mind that it's been a couple of months since the last time I went to a show there, so maybe these changes aren't as new as I think they are. I'm not noting that these changes are negative, just thought it would be cool to have a community discussion;

* Before entry, the staff put a black circle sticker over my phone's camera.
   * I like the intent, but more on this later.
* Security check was more thorough this time, probably took a full minute per person for a couple of guys ahead of me on line.
* Not sure if it's just me, but I thought that the overhead lights were more prominent throughout the night and brighter later in the night (4-ish).
* The fog machine was much more active throughout the night, really trippy vibes :)
* Less staffing overall, around the dance floor and in the restrooms.
   * I don't remember the last time I saw so many phones lit up on the floor, a good handful of people were using their phone's flash as like a glowstick throughout the night.
      * I haven't seen so many phones on the floor at BASEMENT before.
      * Would've been nice to have staff around to maintain the intimate vibe of the floor (a la Nowadays)
      * Also noticed some harassment on the floor, nothing major but didn't seem like there was any staff around who could step in and handle the situation. 
      * No staffing in the bathroom could make some people uncomfortable and not feel safe especially in intergender bathrooms.

Again, not looking to complain, just thought some of these changes were interesting, and overall positive and things that I've thought about before.

EDIT: thanks to everyone who contributed, I didn't expect this thread to get so much attention. I didn't create this thread to attack BASEMENT or management, I was just looking for a discussion and feedback that I could pass back to them and hopefully get the community heard in some way.

2vcm6,fbw32w,"Ambient music & Korean food today, a maximum chill Sunday meetup for electronic music fans","My gf and I are getting an early dinner and checking out an ambient music event at a record store in Williamsburg. I'm bringing some friends that I've met from this community, and wanted to invite some new faces to join our table!

I'm a big fan of Techno and House music, and have been organizing meetups here for a while now. We have a nice little community of ravers, who go out to events together once or twice a month. Last week we went pretty hard at Nowadays where Blawan shot me into a glorious techno vortex that lasted till 730am lol. I wanna let my body recover, and just wanted do something chill this weekend. 

I know this technically isn't a rave, but I believe electronic music has so much to offer beyond the classic nightclub environment. Over the last few years, I've really grown to love ambient music, and find its meditative quality really soothing, especially after a long night where my brain has melted out of my head. 

Sooo, we're going to Halcyon today to check out their [Elixirs of Sound event](https://residentadvisor.net/events/1395750). It features a live ambient set by Brooklyn resident rrao, and some yogi is playing a gong too. *""The space will be set up so that everyone can seat comfortably or lie down during the session. Drinks & relaxing teas available at the bar.""* 

**THE PLAN**

1. We're grabbing Korean food around 5pm near the venue. We have a table for 8 reserved, and have room for 3 more people. If you want to join us for dinner, use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScb0YkkhrcIcPQlK2Vau9h7Lml3ZcbvwZjSug7tSD0Ms0VYUg/viewform?usp=sf_link) and I'll send you details!
2. We're going to head to Halcyon around 6-630ish (finishes at 830 so we can go to bed like normal human beings). It's a limited capacity event so make sure you cop a ticket soon. 
3. If you can't make it today, but want to join our crew for a future Techno event, use the form, and I'll try reaching out when we have a plan.

My friend and I started organizing meetups for House/Techno fans since last year, and now we have a solid crew of regulars who go out together and share a passion for quality electronic music. We usually grab drinks with everyone at a chill bar before getting to the venue, or lately, if we're feeling the DIY spirit, we'll even throw a pre-party in an art space and add our own music and lighting.

I'm very excited for next Saturday, as one of my favorite artists in Techno is playing at what I believe is the best overall club in NYC. Blawan is finally coming back to Nowadays, after having to cancel last year. I think his sound represents many of the essential themes of Techno. Its futuristic machine music that has grit and isn't overly polished and sanitized. His percussion feels like it's made by tribal aliens, but it still maintains a very human, industrial vibe. He often plays vinyl in his DJ sets, and has an incredible improvised hardware project called Karenn (one of my fave boiler room sets evaaa). Check out Blawan's vicious [Unpolished 2019 set](https://soundcloud.com/reaktorevents/blawan-at-unpolished-2019) if you want a taste of his sets.

Hope u all rest up on this long weekend, you're guna need it for Saturday  ;)

-No referral links! Use this space to shout out your event, and links to eventbrite/RA/etc for descriptions. If I see something along the lines of: ""USE CODE PLUR AT CHECK OUT FOR 1 DOLLAR OFF"" it's a ban. 

-One mention per party. Everyone deserves an opportunity to post their event without clutter of the same event being reposted over and over.

-Outline the style of music that will be performed

-Talk about the venue a bit if it is lesser known.

For starters, I updated the rules section to make it more visible. 

We want to be friendly and welcoming to new people who are curious about electronic music and raves, however I don't think this should be a place that caters to noobs who want to do zero research and have opinions fed to them by strangers on the internet. 

People have limited attention spans, the more low quality posts we have on the sub, the more sifting people have to do. Eventually, I think this leads to a lack of engagement and disinterest. I want to get the permission of the other mods first before creating an FAQ section, but let's start by submitting what you guys think are the most redundant questions/type of posts. 

For example, my least favorite common post goes something like this:

*Q: I am in town on <insert date> and I wanna go to a lit rave thing? Tell me what to doooo.* 

*A: This only really annoys me when the OP provides no background or information about what style of music they like. And the answer is always the goddamn same; RESIDENT ADVISOR OR EDMTRAIN!*

2vcm6,f2d44o,GREETINGS - Looking for Intimate Warehouse Spaces in BK,"Hey All,

I was looking online for warehouse spaces in Brooklyn. I happened by your community and I felt compelled to join. It seems like a very friendly environment and everyone seems to be supporting each other's passion for spinning around to the sounds of the universe. 

Before I move any further, I wanted to introduce myself. I'm new to Reddit, but it's definitely something I want to explore more, especially since I would like to start expressing myself with words more often. I just recently started a mailing list but I also think there's a lot of wonderful exchange on Reddit. Indeed ‚Äì this is my first post. But anyway, I digress... DJ knees is my online alter ego. In real life, I'm an Italian student living in New York. I produce music, run a record label and run an events series. I don't want to self-promote so I'll leave out the details. What I would really like to do is start engaging more with the community that I am a part of. So here I am. 

I was curious to know if you could help me out with a lil' something.  I'm on a mission to conceptualize a new kind of party. I feel like there's a lack of affordable warehouse raves with a familiar, intimate and secretive vibe in NYC. Maybe I'm wrong. But, having lived here 4 years now, I've been to parties like ReSolute, Unter, Members Only and, although some of those have been very thrilling, I still feel like they can be expensive and too grandiose. What I'm looking to create is something smaller and homier, modeling the party out of the Chicago raves of the late 80s and early 90s. Something for the heads. Something that can go on until the late (or should I say early!) hours. 

I'm looking for warehouse spaces, ideally in Brooklyn, with a capacity of 100 people. If you guys could point me in any direction, it would be extremely helpful. Even if you know promoters in the area who might know someone who owns spaces and rents it out for parties... Or even a website or a blog where people talk about this... Anything will help! And perhaps it could lead to something very special.

looking forward to dancing wid y'all

They range anywhere from rock n roll, to hip hop, to DJ acts that generally play, but are not limited to video game based music.  After all our years of attending we've always been baffled at the lack of any dedicated Persona acts.  Given that there are so many rockin' songs, with vocals to boot, we've always wondered what it would be like to start a group of our own.  For fun at least.  We're in our late 20s/early 30s with big people responsibilities, so dedication is hard, but we can certainly make time for it.

2u1kt,dtx6rb,Looking for the Warren Ellis to my Nick Cave,"*(OK; I‚Äôll admit this title is a tad ridiculous, but I‚Äôm trying to find a pithy way to communicate what I‚Äôm looking for)*

My name is Will; I‚Äôm a songwriter, singer, engineer and producer from New Zealand, now living in Greenpoint. I‚Äôm a full-time musician, and I‚Äôm working on an art-rock project called Noise.

This is currently a studio project; I‚Äôve just finished mixing the first three singles, and I‚Äôll be diving back into experimentation and songwriting over the winter.

My influences are pretty diverse, but I could reasonably describe Noise as ‚Äú*dark, post-punk-inflected, literary art-rock*‚Äù. I‚Äôm particularly informed by artists like Nick Cave, St Vincent, Jeff Buckley, Benjamin Clementine, Swans, the National, Bill Callahan, Berlin-era Bowie, recent Iggy Pop, Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell, Nine Inch Nails, and Beck.

While I‚Äôm perfectly happy working solo, I‚Äôd absolutely love to find a writing partner. Ideally you‚Äôd be a badass instrumentalist with a strong creative voice, a deep understanding of composition and arrangement, and an enthusiasm for exploring this general creative territory.

I‚Äôm not looking for any specific instrumentation, although I default to guitar, piano, drums and bass. Fundamentally, I‚Äôm interested in creative chemistry, friendship and a shared work ethic!

**Does this sound like you?**  


Here are a few miscellaneous details about me that might seem relevant:

* For better or for worse, I‚Äôm more of a ‚Äúlife calling‚Äù musician than a ‚Äúfor fun‚Äù musician‚Äù. I¬†typically prioritise writing over partying
* I‚Äôm a low baritone, and sound kinda like an antipodean Matt Berninger.
* My background is in English literature and Classics. I‚Äôm into post-modernism, modernist poetry, science fiction, ancient mythology and philosophy. Huge fan of T.S Eliot, Berryman, Murakami, Iain Banks, Ada Palmer, William Gibson and Mervyn Peake.",,False,0.84,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCJam/comments/dtx6rb/looking_for_the_warren_ellis_to_my_nick_cave/

2u1kt,bw1q9m,Looking for a drummer to join our band! Pop Punk/Alternative,"Hey everyone,

My name is Jason and I play guitar and started a band with my identical twin brother (the bassist) and we're from Long Island, NY. Our band Break Out Day is looking for a new drummer. We've been around for a few years and last September, both our singer and drummer told us they were going to be moving out of state this spring. So, we've found a new singer/guitarist already, but still in search of a drummer. We're a serious band, have a strong work ethic, and want to make it a career (don't we all?). We have released two EP's, ""The Nights That Made It"" and ""Echoes of the Past. Both can be found on iTunes, Spotify, etc etc. We've worked hard to develop a following over the years after playing countless shows on Long Island, in Brooklyn and NYC, as well as other places in the Tri-State area. We're looking for someone who loves playing and is dedicated. The response to our two EPs has been incredible and its been incredible to watch the band grow from an idea me and my brother had to where we are now. If you can play multiple instruments that is great, but by no means is it a requirement. If you like to write songs that is also great because our view is more ideas the better. We want to round out our lineup and get back to being active. We're always looking to progress in the best and most efficient way possible. Take a listen to our music and if you like what you hear, send us a message if you're interested. Our singer lives in Brooklyn, so meeting up at a rehearsal space in BK or the city potentially isn't a problem.

Me and my guitarplayer have an album worth of material that we want to share with the world, but we need musicians to do so.

We are looking for a bassist and a drummer and if possible a second guitar. 

The music is Alt./indie prog rock with a wide array of influences. We have an instrumental demo of almost all the songs, and one song demo with vocals. 

For the bass player we need someone with good groove, doesn't matter if you are starting out with your instrument, as long as you work hard and want to learn as much as posible.

We do need a good drummer though. Someone who can play in a vast array of styles and rythms. We have a lot of groove in our songs, but also odd time signature changes, polyrithms, metal, jazz, country parts, so on and so forth. So we do need an experienced drummer.

We will send you the demo on request, and chat a bit about the project and schedule an audition.

I'm a video producer in NYC currently working on a collective documentary project collecting personal stories of struggle and survival from around the world during the coronavirus emergency. It occurred to us that a story that could communicate a lot about the situation here in NYC would be that of a bike messenger or delivery rider who is still working in the midst of the crisis.

So, we'd love to hear from any of you who are in the situation of taking on additional risks and responsibilities as you continue to make deliveries in this unprecedented crisis ‚Äì or, if perhaps you know of someone who fits this description.

Are you continuing to do this because it's your only source of income? Are you continuing because this work is vital to the wellbeing of the people they are delivering to? What is your outlook on this crisis and how it will change our city? These are some of the questions we are thinking about in terms of framing a story like this in NYC.

Shoot me a DM or comment below if you have any insights.

I know you're all probably dealing with a lot right now, so any assistance at all would be much appreciated.

Here's what I come up with right now as good or good-ish, roughly in order of quality of experience:

* The High Bridge. So wide, so empty!
* Willis Avenue Bridge
* Brooklyn Bridge. Ironically! Pedestrian numbers are way down.
* Randalls Island Connector to the Bronx. (RandI is Manhattan! Politically.)
* Most other Harlem-River bridges, so long as you take the lane, not the sidewalk
   * 3rd Avenue, Madison Avenue, 145th Street, Macombs Dam, University Heights, Broadway
* Queensboro

Post bridge crossing thoughts:

First off thanks for commenting and giving me a better feel for what I would be seeing.

Things are pretty loud and a little confusing when you hit 232nd street and go under the #1 train. Lots of traffic. Cement pillars to the right. Parked cars. There is a lot to contend with.


I stayed to the left of all the pillars and parking. The lead up to entering the bridge has a lot of stimuli. The bridge is a metal grate. I was ready for that thanks to u/doodle77. It wasn't a smooth ride but I will continue to take the road. I appreciate the comments about the sidewalk. No real big elevation hit on the bridge. It wasn't wet today so no slipping. I am riding 700C X 38 tires at about 90PSI and was very happy u/doodle77 pointed out the expansion joint on the south side of the bridge. I was looking out for it and bunny hopped it. Maybe I am just keyed up but it might gobble up a 23c or smaller tire.

2ryf6,dpt6bj,Favorite fast casual option (chipotle style restaurants) for lunch in NY?,"I've been noticing a TON of fast casual restaurants spring up especially around the Times Square area, and was wondering which fast casual restaurant you guys like the best. I've been to so many but there are still so many more to try... Here are 2 of my favs:

&#x200B;

1. HoneyBrains (Flatiron District)

[Catch of the Day Bowl](https://preview.redd.it/0nifyyl3nxv31.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=b69e976e1840f6f6e70448398a8f53eca9db75d7)

&#x200B;

[Chicken Bowl](https://preview.redd.it/f3jgk3t6nxv31.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c7da9db68841d5ab6246d39e4bea0bda3bb0a9d)

Really good. And super healthy. HoneyBrains really dedicates itself to making healthy food for the brain, and all over the restaurant you will see marketing and scientific facts about the benefits of legumes and omega-3s.

I feel like most fast casual nowadays are just putting together disparate ingredients and they don't always go together well, but HoneyBrains gives you set choices and they all taste great because they've put culinary thought behind what ingredients go well together. Definitely a bit pricey though. Chicken bowl will come out to around \~$14 after tax.

Taste: 4/5

Healthiness: 5/5

Value (how worth it): 3.5/5

What to try: Chicken Bowl (their most popular item)

&#x200B;

2. Two Forks (Times square)

[Grass fed Beef with Sweet Potato and Roasted Broccoli](https://preview.redd.it/0jwdx4l8nxv31.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d75edc15c53d55931039cf81f327428253eb7e1b)

Super solid. I've noticed that many fast casual restaurants, because the ingredients are usually pretty simple, try to overcompensate for flavor by putting way too much oil in the food, and it just destroys the whole point of trying to eat healthy foods in the first place. I call this the Gordon Ramsay. Just watch any of this cooking videos and you'll see what I mean. One example is DigInn. Sweetgreen is also guilty of this unless you specifically ask them to go easy.

I like Two Forks because they don't do that, and after eating it, you still feel pretty good about yourself, and the food is pretty tasty too. Think of it like DigInn but less oil.

Taste: 3.5/5

Healthiness: 4/5

Value: 3.5/5

What to try: Grass fed Beef with Farro

That annoys me and I don't want to be a sucker.

At the same time, I imagine some of the more experimental restaurants might mark up because they have a legitimately better menu on Valentine's day.  I'm thinking of Michelin-level here, like Contra.  Blanca is already booked, bah.  I think it could be really interesting to see some creative high-level takes on Valentine's day themed food.  

Do you agree with my logic?  Should I just stay in on Valentine's day because I'll inevitably be screwed and take a voucher from my SO to splurge on a restaurant on a different day?

So if you ever visit on your birthday, you might as well get a free meal. It‚Äôs actually a buffet that you cook at your table. 

I highly recommend their Tom Yum soup base for the hotpot. 

Then I would order the following:
Beef, Lamb, Watercress, Enoki Mushroom, Fried Tofu Skin.

Since it is a buffet you can order as many other items as you can eat. They don‚Äôt want you to be wasteful, so you should order what you can eat, otherwise they may charge you for the food you don‚Äôt finish. 

All you need to do when the bill comes is to tell them it‚Äôs your birthday and show them your driver‚Äôs license as the id. They will just charge you the tax for the meal. You should probably pay a tip as well.

I have a friend coming out of town who really appreciates good food and I want to really show him what NYC has to offer. By good food (subjective I know!), I mean something like:

32xtn,dpszv0,What is your favorite fast casual (chipotle style) lunch option?,"I've been noticing a TON of fast casual restaurants spring up especially around the Times Square area, and was wondering which fast casual restaurant you guys like the best. I've been to so many but there are still so many more to try... Here are 2 of my favs:

&#x200B;

1. HoneyBrains (Flatiron District)

[Chicken Bowl](https://preview.redd.it/g2wexr85ixv31.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=35c17d1a9ffabf42236c1534bc1a20b33e1515d3)

[Catch of the Day Bowl](https://preview.redd.it/1nldc081jxv31.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=29283b93ff25b69f96cf35f393bb1bd8b428955a)

Really good. And super healthy. HoneyBrains really dedicates itself to making healthy food for the brain, and all over the restaurant you will see marketing and scientific facts about the benefits of legumes and omega-3s. 

I feel like most fast casual nowadays are just putting together disparate ingredients and they don't always go together well, but HoneyBrains gives you set choices and they all taste great because they've put culinary thought behind what ingredients go well together. Definitely a bit pricey though. Chicken bowl will come out to around \~$14 after tax.

Taste: 4/5

Healthiness: 5/5

Value (how worth it): 3.5/5

What to try: Chicken Bowl (their most popular item)

&#x200B;

2. Two Forks (Times square)

[Grass-fed Beef with Sweet Potato and Broccoli](https://preview.redd.it/teoz183mlxv31.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=618b86815d82e4871c2d521cbc8346be3f8b5aa5)

Super solid. I've noticed that many fast casual restaurants, because the ingredients are usually pretty simple, try to overcompensate for flavor by putting way too much oil in the food, and it just destroys the whole point of trying to eat healthy foods in the first place. I call this the Gordon Ramsay. Just watch any of this cooking videos and you'll see what I mean. One example is DigInn. Sweetgreen is also guilty of this unless you specifically ask them to go easy.

I like Two Forks because they don't do that, and after eating it, you still feel pretty good about yourself, and the food is pretty tasty too. Think of it like DigInn but less oil.

Taste: 3.5/5

Healthiness: 4/5

Value: 3.5/5

What to try: Grass fed Beef with Farro

Mexican (mainly just want tacos though): Taqueria, Casa de Julia, Los Tacos No. 1

Japanese: Sugarfish, would love some more medium priced options

She's visiting me in the city over the holidays and I've decided this is going to be a food-centered vacation. I've lived here almost six years - she's visited a handful of times, and I've taken her to some pretty good places, but I really want to hit up some spots one would put on an NYC food ""bucket list,"" both upscale and cheaper eats. Some I've been to and some I haven't, and my mother hasn't been to any of them. My list so far:

Gramercy Tavern

Jing Fong (been here, love the experience of it)

Veselka (been here a few times)

Russ & Daughters

Marseille (been here, a cute brunch spot)

I wanted to pick a Michelin star place; I've taken my mother to Minetta Tavern before, which we both enjoyed. I've done NoMad myself which I thought was excellent. Neither of us have done Gramercy Tavern. I was thinking it'd be a good Xmas Eve dinner, assuming I can get a reservation. Is there a better choice? I'd like somewhere where the service is a little extra special (like how at NoMad they bring out your chicken so you can see how it's being cooked).

32xtn,dklny7,Let‚Äôs create Yelp for NYC food,"Dear Reddit,

I often see people post here asking for the best steak or burger in the city. About a year ago, i started to wonder - in 2019, how is there no crowd-sourced answer to ""what's the best burger in NYC?"" 

So I set out to see whether an app exists that's similar to Yelp but focused on the food. I was surprised to discover that several apps have tried, but none of them have become household names. I decided to dig deeper to see why so many attempts ended in failure, and found a similarity: none of the previous apps actually had the restaurants menus. They all expected users to add that information. 

So I did what any sane person would do. I wrote them all down by hand. 

And so today, 2,000,000 dishes later, I'm revealing the fruits of some very hard labor right here on Reddit. 

An app called Plater. ( Link @ bottom )

I've tried to make the app as convenient and simple as possible. So much so that you don't need to log in. 

The core features are: 

- Search for the best burger / pizza / your favorite dish nearby (based on reviews you and others post)
- Search dishes by dietary preferences (ie: vegan), price or menu (ie: served @ brunch)
- Vote for your top 3 favorite burgers / pizzas, etcso we can finally have crowd-sourced lists of the people's favorites. 
- See restaurant menus with photos, reviews and pricing. 
- Share menu links with ppl you're eating with so they can choose the best things on the menu. 
- Tag dishes as vegan, vegetarian,or by allergens and search them accordingly
- see friend recommendations when you search or when viewing a menu (must log in for this one)
- Bookmark dishes that look awesome and send links to friends. (log in for bookmarks, links work w/o log in)

These features are just a starting point, and moving forward, what i really want to know is what features you guys would like to see built. 

Please give it a try and reach out to me here with any and all feedback. I'm particularly interested in things like: ""as soon as _____ happened, I got frustrated and closed the app"", or ""I found the app useful when I ______"". Any moments that triggered memorable thoughts are particularly useful. 

And if you'll help by taking part in a usability test, I'll come to your local coffee shop and buy you a coffee.

Lastly, please share with friends who might be interested. Building something great requires feedback from a lot of people. 

Many thanks!

A lot more bar patrons, which I obviously enjoy on occasion, but Idunno, there's something about settling in with a flick or two that just really makes me feel content and happy

Before I came out here, I had a massive collection of DVDs and Blu-rays, including a huge wall of Criterion Collection films. I had to pare it down substantially, but I've still got a good bunch. There's some things I'm not partial to, but I'm pretty open-minded and films and directors I love span the globe and the history of film back to the silent era. Wanna dive into the mad brilliance of Herzog or some absurdist blasphemy of Bunuel? Awesome, I'm down. Wanna scroll through Netflix new releases and see how they fare? Sounds great, I'll bring a sixer. Waiting to see Us until you can find someone to go with because from what you've heard you know you're gonna wanna talk about it with someone afterwards?

2vb9h,a7846y,Anyone interested in going into the jewelry business?,"Hello all,

A close family friend of mine in the Bronx has been in the jewelry business for 40+ years, and is looking to partner with someone younger who can work with him on his ecommerce operation. I was wondering if a local artist might be a good fit for the role?

About eight years ago he expanded his business onto Amazon. Sales were great until the last year or so, when he shifted his focus to other parts of his jewelry business. He‚Äôs an older guy, and his feeling is that someone young and tech-savvy could do a better job taking full advantage of the Amazon business he's built. Someone who could put time into things like basic social media marketing, SEO, and expanding to new jewelry products and marketplaces.

Ideally, he'd like to partner with someone younger who can do those things, and split the business with them. He can also teach them the ins-and-outs of jewelry sourcing as part of the partnership.

In his words, ‚Äúthis would be perfect for someone looking to get into the jewelry business. I could teach anyone.‚Äù

Would someone here be interested? In addition to his experience developing jewelry products, his factory relationships, and his existing ecommerce inventory, he also brings to the table a seller account that has excellent ratings, and is already approved to sell fine jewelry. That approval is a big deal because it takes over a year to get, along with some heavy auditing and a number of other requirements. Amazon forbids sellers from offering jewelry made with precious metals or precious stones unless they have that approval.

This guy is one of the nicest people I know, and I think he‚Äôd be a great business partner! If you‚Äôre interested, drop me a DM and I‚Äôll put you in touch with him for a phone chat.

All the best!

Happy Tuesday! Here's a sneak peak into the new off-Broadway show My Parsifal Conductor.

As you can see, the stage and costumers are beautifully done and displayed. The characters are well-brought to life by the amazing cast that includes Eddie Korbich (*A Gentleman‚Äôs Guide to Love and Murder, A Christmas Story (Santa), The Little Mermaid (Scuttle),* Geoffrey Cantor (Netflix's Daredevil and new series, Maniac), and Jazmin Gorsline (*Love Never Dies* and *My Fair Lady*).

2vb9h,1lzmc8,Mid-Manhattan Library presents A Concentration in Cuts: The Paper Cut Art of Thomas Witte,"An Illustrated Lecture, Monday, September 16th 2013 at 6:30 PM on the 6th floor. 

Mid-Manhattan Library
455 Fifth Avenue, New York. 

The artist presents a detailed narrative describing the evolution of his work from a sculptor to a paper cut artist. He invites the audience to experience his process as he selects phots, meticulously draws his map, and carefully cuts the paper. Though his work is only compromised of white paper and void, he creates the illusion of textures, line, shadow and depth. 

His work is based on a trove of slides that have inspired both the content and the process of his work. He depicts scenes from contemporary Brooklyn as well as vintage images from his Grandfather's travels. The photos themselves serve many different purposes, and he looks at each photo with his own intentions. He shares his experiences as he connects with particular images both past and present. Finally, he offers a glimpse into the technical world of cutting paper: the physical struggle and the mental exercise of transforming the piece of white paper. 

Thomas Witte studied sculpture at Rutgers University. After graduating, he traveled to Argentina, where he found himself drawn to the vibrant stencil graffiti scene, his time there solidified his interest in the technique. The artist's focus has shifted from mark making to the paper-cut stencils themselves. During the past year he has had his first solo show in NYC. His work has been on exhibit at the Davidson Contemporary gallery, the Central Brooklyn Public Library, Rivington Design House, PULSE Contemporary Art Fair and the Berkshire Museum in Massachusetts. Most recently the MTA Arts for Transit has commissioned him to create paper cuts for light boxes located Grand Central Station as part of a year-long exhibition celebrating the 100th anniversary of the station.

I‚Äôm visiting this week from Denver and am looking for a bottle or can shop that sells a lot of local/east coast beer that you can‚Äôt find anywhere else. Some place that sells 4 packs or even single cans/BYO 6 packs so I can take a wide variety back with me in my suitcase. Where‚Äôs a good spot for that? I‚Äôm located on the Upper East Side but am willing to travel, the greater variety and the rarer the finds the better. 

In addition to this, also looking to add a brewery or two to my tour. I‚Äôm a big NEIPA fan and Other Half has been one of my bucket list destinations for a while. Probably going to spend a good few hours there. Other ones I‚Äôve been watching and waiting to try are Grimm in Brooklyn and Threes Brewing also in Brooklyn.  Anywhere else cranking out world-class brews? Specifically IPAs, hazies, and sours, but I‚Äôm open to more variety if it‚Äôs worth the trip. I also assume all of those places do can sales out of the brewery, so I‚Äôll be stocking up for my trip home.

2t2vk,d3ekxj,Be part of a homebrew tour!,"Hello NYC beer drinkers and makers! For the past 10 years, writer Joshua M. Bernstein has been leading homebrew tours in New York City. I‚Äôll be taking over the planning and leading the tours, and my first plan of action is to compile a list of brewers who might be interested in potentially being a stop on the tour. 

If you‚Äôre unfamiliar, the tours consist of stops at the homes of 3 different homebrewers (that live within a reasonable walking distance from each other.) Tours consist of about 30 guests and each stop lasts one hour. As a brewer you would be required to brew at least 2 different styles and at least 5 gallons total. Your compensation would be a generous gift certificate for Bitter and Esters, a homebrew shop in Prospect Heights, BK, that will more than cover the cost of 2 brews and then some. 

So! The first step I‚Äôd like to take to aid me logistically is to compile a list of interested homebrewers, and where they live. If being a stop on this tour sounds like something that excites you, what I need is for you to e-mail me at brettvanderbrook [at] gmail [dot] com with your name and the neighborhood you live in. An address would be even better, but if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable with that a ‚Äòhood will suffice. This list will help me in finding brewers who live close together, and planning a route that makes sense. 

Please know that expressing interest is in no way a commitment. All you‚Äôre letting me know today is ‚Äúyeah, I might be into that.‚Äù You can absolutely change your mind at any time. Also no worries if you‚Äôve been a stop on a tour before. There‚Äôs no reason we can‚Äôt have repeats in the future. The tours will happen roughly 3-4 times per year. 

If you‚Äôre not a brewer but think you‚Äôd enjoy being on one of these tours, be on the lookout in the future for information regarding the dates and times!",,False,1.0,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/nycbeer/comments/d3ekxj/be_part_of_a_homebrew_tour/

Why settle for less? build you own masterpiece and show the architects and town planners who's really the boss!

The pilot project deals with the public space around the United Nations Headquarters. It's not necessary to be an expert on the area to participate, I am simply interested in attaining a broad range of input from a variety of users.

Within the project, we are investigating the harsh borders of the United Nations, and assuming a clean slate approach, where the highly restricted grounds are made publicly available again.

2zhoc,czun29,"2019 Fall Dart League - Brooklyn, NY","Hey Reddit Darters!

A Fall 2019 Dart League across four great bars local to Brooklyn will start be starting up again in just a few short weeks.

The regular season will go eight weeks.  And in order to qualify for the playoffs, darters must attend *no fewer than five of the eight regular season tournaments.*

In addition to this, the weekly tournaments will be held on Sunday evenings. Hopefully this will work out for everyone involved.  ***REMINDER: YOU MUST ATTEND FIVE OF THE EIGHT REGULAR SEASON TOURNAMENTS.***

Here are the rules and scheduling info for the 2019 fall season:

***Schedule***

The season will begin on ***Sunday, September 22nd***. There will be eight regular season events, each held on a ***Sunday***, with warm ups starting at 6:30 PM and tournament ***play beginning at 7 PM sharp***. 

The locales are well established, solid whiskey bars with veteran bartenders and crafty dart players. Bring your A game (Jack said that). The venue will rotate between the four bars listed below, so that each bar hosts a tournament twice:

* Moot Bar - 579 Myrtle Avenue (Classon cross street)
* Landline - 790 Grand Street
* The Watershed - 517 Court Street
* Uncle Barry's - 58 Fifth Avenue

The regular season tournament schedule is as follows:

* Tournament 1: Sunday, September 22nd, Uncle Barry's
* Tournament 2: Sunday, September 29th, Moot Bar
* Tournament 3: Sunday, October 6th, The Watershed
* Tournament 4: Sunday, October 13th, Landline
* Tournament 5: Sunday, October 20th, Uncle Barry's
* Tournament 6: Sunday, October 27th, Moot Bar
* Tournament 7: Sunday, November 3rd, The Watershed
* Tournament 8: Sunday, November 10th, Landline

***League Play***

After successful years of tournaments, we've found the following to work best for the darters that quest for glory.  Each regular season tournament will be double-elimination, with a winner's and a loser's bracket. Matches in the earliest rounds of the tournament will consist of a single game of Baseball. Once the tournament is down to 8 players, matches will consist of a single game of Cricket without points. The final match of the tournament will be a single game of 301.

Seeding for the first tournament will be done by random number generator. The seeding for all other regular season tournaments will be based on performance in the previous tournament, with that tournament's two finalists pitted against each other in the opening round of the new tournament, then the two semi-finalists, then the two pairs of quarter finalists, and then everyone else. 

The winner of a regular season tournament will receive a prize of $50.

***Playoff Tournament***

After completion of the six regular season tournaments, the top eight (8) players will be invited to compete in a final playoff tournament, to be held Sunday, November 17, at one of the four bars. In order to be eligible for the final tournament, a player ***must have participated in at least five of the eight regular season tournaments.*** Qualification for the final playoff tournament will be determined by the total number of Playoff Points accrued over the course of the regular season; ***the eight players with the most Playoff Points at the end of the regular season will qualify for the final tournament.*** 

Playoff Points will be awarded to all players who compete in a regular season tournament. Playoff Points will be awarded in the following way:

* Participating in a regular season tournament: 2 Playoff Points
* Each match won in a regular season tournament: 1 Playoff Point
* Making the finals of a regular season tournament: 2 Playoff Points
* Winning a regular season tournament: 3 Playoff Points

In a twelve-player double-elimination tournament, the maximum number of Playoff Points that can be earned is 12:

* 2 for participating
* 5 for the five matches won 
* 2 for making the finals
* 3 for winning the finals

In the event that multiple players who qualify, or could qualify, for the final tournament, have an equal total number of Playoff Points, a tiebreaker match consisting of a single game of 301 will be held to determine the higher seed/who qualifies. 

The final playoff tournament will be single elimination, with each match consisting of three games: one game of Baseball, one game of Cricket and one game of 301, to be played in any order. Each player will choose one of the three games and, if tied after the first two, the third game will be played to determine the winner. (told you we worked this out)

The player with the most Playoff Points at the end of the regular season will be seeded first, the player with the second-most Playoff Points will be seeded second, and so forth. The first round of the final tournament will have the (1) seed playing the (8) seed, the (2) against the (7), (3) versus (6) and (4) versus (5). The winners of the (1) vs. (8) and (4) vs. (5) matches will play each other in the semifinals, and the winners of the other two matches will play each other. The winners of those matches will play each other in the final match of the final tournament, and you could be crowned the ultimate winner for the Brooklyn Dart League Champion for Fall 2019 across the bars.

Payout for the final tournament will be as follows:

* Quarterfinal round losers: $40
* Semifinal round losers: $60
* Runner-up: $120
* Winner: $300

***League Dues etc.***

Each participant in Dart League will contribute $40 in league dues. 

Leave $40 with a bartender at any of the four bars with your name, e-mail and phone number or ask them for the coordinators Venmo account to join.  Also practice while you're at the bar.  Hell, have a drink even.

And that's basically it! If possible, let the league know if you'll be able to participate sooner rather than later as we need to get a sense of numbers for this upcoming season.

Finally, another congrats to our Spring 2019 champion Nicholas. We wish him the best of luck defending his title and wish you the best of luck dethroning him.

Only problem is the sister of the bride to be is 20. The rest of us are in our mid to late 20s. I've scoured the internet for hours and I have had very little luck finding a place that is 18 to enter 21 to drink. We're from way out of town so I have my fingers crossed that someone with local experience might know of a fun place. A place that has dancing is preferred, but at this point anything we can around 10 at night would be fine (karaoke, bowling, comedy etc).

2zhoc,6qmxbs,Great Bar for Craft Beer and...yes...Mocktails,"Weird request, I know, but my pregnant wife and I will be staying in Midtown a few weekends from.  When not pregnant, she is a craft beer and cocktail drinker like myself who enjoys going out to new places, especially while we're travelling.  Since she's been pregnant, she has discovered that she really enjoys a good mocktail, and it still feels like a special drink.

With that said, she's had much better luck with places that actually have mocktails on their menu.  Sure, any decent bartender can whip something up that looks fancy and probably tastes great, but she's also found that when it's on the fly like that, most bartenders will err on the side of sweet even when she specifically ask them not to go too sweet.  Also, given that we'll be there on the weekend, asking a bartender to make something up off the top of their head can be a pain in the ass.  

So rather than risk it with asking a busy bartender on the weekend to make something up and hope they get it right we were hoping that you lovely folks of r/nycbars had a few recommendations of places that already have some mocktails printed on the menu.  That means they've already thought the drink through, should be prepared to make it quickly and without much thought, and hopefully there will be a few options at least.

The ideal place (as mentioned above) would have a great craft beer selection, but it'd also have food, decent music, and not be so loud that we can't carry on a conversation.  Let me know what you've got r/nycbeer!  Looking forward to hearing back from you.

2zhoc,6ov9wt,Has anyone been to abq nyc aka the Breaking Bad rv bar?,"Has anyone been??? Im interested in hearing others feedback. 

We went last night and were super excited. We had been waiting for months and had been following all the updates on fb. The second we stepped into the rv all that excitement immediately turned to disappointment. About 24 of us were corralled like cattle with 4 servers into this sweatbox of an rv, with no ac in 90 degree heat for the next 2 hrs. The rv was even hotter than the weather outside. We were given light weight yellow jackets that resembled the suits out of the series but could barely stand to put them on because we were all already drenched in sweat within the first 2 minutes. The gloves they gave us appeared to still have remnants of sweat from previous use and smelled awful, the goggles and the mixing bottles were greasy and had finger prints all over them, not to mention most of the bottles didnt even have labels. The staff seemed to be running back and forth, trying to cleab our beakers and glasses as fast as they could as if they didnt have enough for everyone. They also seemed to run out of supplies, one of the drinks was supposed to have pop rocks and the staff said they were making their own but their own didnt resemble pop rocks at all and really just looked like paprika was sprinkled onto our drinks. Towards the end I called one of the waiters over to ask where all the memorabilia from the series was, which was what I had been really looking forward to seeing and he explained that the london rv had worked with the series to building the rv but this had not been the case when they brought it to ny so they had not been licensed to use the name or anything related to the series...wait WHAT??? So I had seen all these clips of the rv with memorabilia that was in fact the london rv and not the ny rv...how misleading. I suddenly felt cheated out of $80 and my time. To add insult to injury, at the very end the staff walked around offering shots from bottles. The couple we were with each took one and turned to us in disbelief  to tell us it was straight up sugar and water mixed together...no way, we had to try for ourselves and in fact thats exactly what it was. No a trace of vodka in the ""vodka shots"" they had offered us. The staff then thanked us for coming and rushed us out the door so that they could let their friends in as we were the last group for the night. Save your money, it was a terrible disappointment. I wish I could get a refund. Im pretty sure the health department would have a field day with this place.",,False,0.72,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCBars/comments/6ov9wt/has_anyone_been_to_abq_nyc_aka_the_breaking_bad/

2zhoc,5i68i2,HELP! Bar just canceled after confirming party reservation and I need a last-minute backup!,"Every year for the past 6 years, my friends and I have done a big holiday party (100-125 people throughout the night) with our friends. It's a great time every year and everyone loves it and comes back year after year. 

In the past we did it at Fontana's, a big bar in the LES that had lots of room, great music and dancing, a friendly staff and that never got that crowded. Unfortunately, they went out of business last year, so we were looking for a new venue for this year. After a bit of searching we booked One and One, which told us we had their entire downstairs room for our group until midnight and priority in the line after they opened the downstairs to the public. 

Unfortunately, they called us today and told us they can no longer accommodate us. There would be no guaranteed space and there's another event planned there on the same night, meaning we'd have to wait in line. Essentially, we are shit out of luck there. (We are kinda pissed and have no idea how they could confirm several weeks ago and go back and forth with us since then on logistics, etc., only to cancel at the last minute.)

Anyway, now we are looking for a backup venue. We are calling a few places but given the timing, we're a bit desperate. Does anyone know any good, big bar with enough space to accommodate our group that I should try? Any suggestions would be helpful! We prefer Manhattan but would do BK too.

I sort of addicted to music, and hearing music I don't like can irritate me. I have spots for live music and jazz club, but for this I'm looking for places that have a DJ. Every bar I go to plays generic and popular stuff/singles from the past and present and from all genres (i.e. shake it off, that girl is poison, where are you now, trap queen, etc.). The genres I listen to are hiphop, electronic, indie rock, some R&B(marvin gaye, prince, stevie wonder, frank ocean), some jazz, etc. I wanna find a place that plays some more artsy stuff by less known artists (my favorites that fit that category: Flying Lotus, Jamie xx, Lcd sound system, neon indian, grimes, J Dilla, james blake, tame impala, arcade fire, run the jewels, the xx). And also plays songs from well-known artist, but not their singles/well known songs [i.e.Kanye west (songs like send it up, on sight, barry bond, hell of a life), Outkast (songs like synthesizer and aquemini instead of hey ya), kendrick lamar(wesley's theory, u, institutionalized), daft punk, frank ocean(pyramids, sweet life). And also plays music I possibly never heard before so I can discover new music. I don't mind a popular song here and there, but I don't want to listen to the generic/popular songs. I wanna listen to music that is more intelligently produced. I know places wanna play stuff for everybody, but I know there's a large group of people who listen to the same artists and songs that I do, and are equally obsessed, so if anyone knows any spots that sort fit that description, I would greatly appreciate it.

2xuiv,finqbn,[Hiring] Freelance solidity/ethereum developer for seed stage gaming company.,"Please dm your information if you are interested in 
discussing this gig.

I am starting a web gaming company with an emphasis on free games and NFT games.

I have some basic web and graphic design skills. The company is based in Brooklyn. We already have some value as a company in the form of proprietary assets.

There are three aspects of the development. Applying for all or just one is fine.

1) Token and proprietary smart contract.
2) Basic game on Ethereum blockchain.
3) Basic online multiplayer game built on the Loom Network.

Pardon if this is random but I'm going to explain the situation. The sec makes ICO fundraising very difficult. It's by no means impossible but there are so many random details it can make you nuts. In order to properly get advice from an attorney we need to know exactly what and how we are developing in order to make sure its all legal. For this I need an experienced developer.


Legality of securities offerings goes as far as to take ""intentions"" into consideration. Therefore I am looking for someone who would be willing to establish a personal relationship, maybe even meet for coffee or something. This is why I am specifically posting in NYC.

We have limited funds until we finish fundraising.We can pay cash upfront until our funds run out or perhaps discuss a cash/equity or profit share deal.

If you are interested, capable and we get along perhaps you would consider joining the team as a developer and tech adviser. 

Also if you love retro games that's a plus. When we discuss the details in full you'll see where this project has some cool vibes and existing value.",,False,0.81,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyctech/comments/finqbn/hiring_freelance_solidityethereum_developer_for/

# Back End Engineer
Bermi is a video sharing app trying to reinvent and democratize the way content is shared online. As it is now, you can create a meme that goes viral and is used by millions of people and you end up with exactly zero dollars to show for it, while online content providers serve ads and profit from your meme. It might seem silly to worry about memes but if someone creates content that ends up being enjoyed by millions, they should reap the rewards. We think so, anyway.

Bermi uses the fact that cryptocurrencies have the ability to provide small fractional transactions in order to compensate people for liking, sharing, and recommending content. We envision a new world where profits from online content creation aren't distributed to the publishing platform in a winner-take-all fashion.

This opportunity is on-site, in New York City, and they sponsor h1b applicants.


# Company Size and Health
Bermi is VC funded and they are a true product company. All the engineers have impressive backgrounds, coming from great schools or other great tech companies. But we don't discriminate against people based on pedigree. We let the quality of your code do the talking for you. The team is around 14 people and mostly engineers.

Bermi's office is a beautiful penthouse in Wall Street. The building has a pool and the office has many amenities, including beautiful views of Manhattan, the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, New Jersey, and Brooklyn. Snacks and meals are provided.

Bermi's video sharing app has 500,000 daily active users, mostly in Latin America. The only way to have a steep career trajectory is by either founding your own successful startup or by joining one. Successful startups grow much faster than they can hire good talent, so naturally there are always opportunities for you to pick up slack and provide additional value if you are so inclined. If you fill a responsibility vacuum well, you will most likely get promoted into that role, and you can keep that going until you rise to the C suite. Joining a company like Bermi, full of brilliant minds, maximizes your chances of experiencing an explosive career trajectory.

2xuiv,bxgnre,[HIRING] PinchMe is looking for a Product Manager,"Apply at   [https://codefor.cash/pinchme-product-manager](https://codefor.cash/pinchme-product-manager) 

&#x200B;

PINCHme.com is a New York based company that operates a leading product sampling and digital promotions platform. PINCHme.com‚Äôs platform intelligently matches large Fast Moving Consumer Good (‚ÄúFMCG‚Äù) brands with PINCHme.com‚Äôs own members, who are consumers that have provided PINCHme.com with comprehensive personal data about themselves and their spending habits. In return for the data they provide, PINCHme.com‚Äôs members receive free samples of products already available in-store or access to products ahead of their store release, while the FMCG brands receive detailed insights, product reviews, and feedback and social media engagement, all of which assist in driving sales uplift.

## Company Size and Health

PINCHme is building one of the largest and most profiled consumer databases in the US in a very efficient way, by giving away free product samples, in exchange for members‚Äô first-party data. As the effectiveness of traditional mass marketing (tv, radio, print) declines, companies increasingly turn to innovative, smart providers like PINCHme to gain valuable insights from users in their target markets. Many of PINCHme's clients are household names such as P&G, L‚ÄôOr√©al, Johnson & Johnson, Unilever, Nestle Purina, Kellogg‚Äôs and Kraft.

PINCHme‚Äôs office is located in Soho, NYC with a dynamic team of 35 young entrepreneurs and two playful dogs, Reggie and Gregory.

As a software engineer, you will be eligible to participate in the company's staff equity plan, and PINCHme is publicly traded so stock is liquid. PINCHme has been in business for six years and is profitable with $4.3 million in revenue.

The following are some highlights from PINCHme's FY2018 performance:

* Members up 36% to 4.8 m
* Sampling programs up 35% to 123
* Data monetization revenue up 136% to USD 4.1m (AUD 5.7m)
* Revenue up 18% to AUD 9.4m (AUD 13.0m)

PINCHme‚Äôs community growth is highly correlated to the volume of samples distributed on a monthly basis, creating a very strong network effect ‚Äì more samples, more members, more members, more data, more data, more monetization. This is the reason why the company's immediate focus is not on profitability - they are intelligently trying to win the network effects race.

## Open Position: Product Manager

PINCHme is looking for a swiss-army-knife of a product manager: someone who can embrace the chaos and has an action bias. We need a technical, data-driven doer with an entrepreneurial spirit that embraces iterative development and can work beside a young, dynamic engineering team.

**Responsibilities:**

* Iteratively improving the product through A/B testing using tools such as VWO
* Writing product requirement documents that are informative and actionable

* Running PINCHme‚Äôs weekly product meeting to get buy-in from stakeholders
* Writing user stories, epics and other tickets in Jira to ensure timely delivery of roadmap milestones
* Running and owning agile ceremonies including sprint planning, spring retrospective, demos, and daily standup
* Testing features and products in development to ensure they meet requirements and to optimize the UI/UX
* Defining QA integration test cases to find both server-side and client-side bugs or UX issues before release

**Must Have Requirements:**

* 2+ years of consumer-facing online business experience with a proven track record of successful projects.
* Previous experience acting as a business analyst, product owner or product manager

2xuiv,bn1u4a,[Hiring] [NYC] Market Leading RoboAdvisor (Fintech) firm looking for an engineering manager. NYC Based. Great perks and work environment.," **Apply at**  [**https://codefor.cash/betterment-engineering-manager**](https://codefor.cash/betterment-engineering-manager)   


Betterment is an online financial advisor built for people who refuse to settle for average investing. We‚Äôre here to disrupt finance in a big way. The people who already know how to do that don‚Äôt exist. We‚Äôre hiring for learners and adapters‚Äîpeople who can help us make financial services the way it ought to be.

The service is designed to help increase customers‚Äô long-term returns and lower taxes for retirement planning, building wealth, and other financial goals. By adding transparency to the financial services industry, betterment is a force for social good.

**This opportunity is on-site, in New York City.**.

## Company Size and Health

RoboAdvising is a category of financial advising that has been exploding in popularity due to the fact that Roboadvisors are much more transparent and offer better returns. With human active managers charging exorbitant fees and incurring transaction costs, your money ends up actually growing less over time than it would with a more passive, algorithmic approach. This is the value proposition of RoboAdvisors.

Betterment is the largest RoboAdvisory firm that is independently owned. The only two RoboAdvisors larger than Betterment are subdivisions of companies that have decades worth of a head start in gathering assets under management.

Betterment has raised $275m in funding, they have 16 billion assets under management, and $30m in yearly revenue. This is not a company sitting on a foundation of fluff and dreams of changing the world, they know how to generate value.

## Perks

* Competitive benefits including medical, 401k, dental, parental leave, even gym/yoga reimbursements.
* Team meals made by a house chef and beer on tap.
* Unlimited paid vacation.

You‚Äôll collaborate closely with product & design teams to advance the look and feel of new features/products.

We strive for fluid, delightful user experience and leverage the entire stack to realize these goals. We face scale and architecture challenges as well, but we're looking for someone interested at tackling both hard engineering problems and hard usability problems.

#### Responsibilities:

* Find ways to validate decisions through experimentation and iteration
* Create opportunities for your team to grow and excel
* Decompose long-term projects into small, releasable achievements that provide incremental value to customers

## Job Requirements and Perks

We are looking for innovators who care about crafting excellent user experiences, pragmatic programming, and lean engineering.

#### Requirements:

* Have a real passion for software engineering and building delightful experiences

# Pearl Capital Hiring Sr. Software Engineer


Pearl Capital is a financial technology startup with a leading position in the sub-prime merchant cash advance space. We fund small to medium-sized businesses and broker funding arrangements between merchants and other lenders.

We are seeking a talented full-time senior developer to help build out a range of internal and external facing systems and web services, which will need to interact using different technologies and protocols. Coding will involve various languages ranging from Java/C++ to custom scripting and web languages. The ideal candidate will be excited about building and maintaining client/server systems that need to interact reliably on a day-to-day basis, and less focused on the language being used.


## Company Size and Health


Pearl Capital is a Fintech company whose business model generates extra liquidity for small merchants. They are a brilliant business that takes the Amazon ""platformization"" idea (everything you do in house you should offer it in a XaaS model as well) to heart. Pearl Capital is a merchant cash advance business, but they also allow other investors to come in and jointly fund deals in their portfolio and they white label their internal software for other Merchant Cash Advance companies to use it in their operation. You seldom see companies that ""get"" the modern world of business this well.

Pearl Capital is Venture backed, having raised $35m in funding but they also have revenues in the $20m range. They are a huge business supporting a tremendous amount of _financial transactions_. This is not your average selfie startup, resiliency and software quality matters here.

Pearl's strategy is white glove and they provide a tremendous amount of help and support (marketing, strategy, underwriting) to their Merchant Cash Advance business partners. The company is being built on a rock-solid foundation of long-lasting relationships, as well as extreme end to end product quality. Everything is _elite_ quality, from the illustrations on their main site to the quality of their back end code and the marketing help they provide to their partners.


## Open Position: Sr. Software Engineer


This role will have a direct impact on company growth, working closely with the business to improve existing systems and build out the next generation of products that our clients and customers will interact with. This is a hands-on position for a software author ‚Äì someone who is passionate about being a great programmer.

Responsibilities:

*   Participate in all stages of software development lifecycle: design, develop, test, deploy, maintain, and improve software;
*   Manage individual project priorities, deadlines and deliverables;
*   Interact with the business users to gather requirements;
*   Enhance existing business systems to support our changing marketplace;
*   Build out new applications to support our customers / white-label initiatives;
*   Work with members of our research, CRM, and web teams to build integrations between the various systems.


## Job Requirements, and Benefits


We are looking for an experienced individual who is a lifelong learner and who's passionate about **correctness** in the software they build. The compensation is very competitive and includes full benefits and 401k.

### Requirements:

*   7+ years hands-on development experience with at least one system/application-level language such as Java or C/C++;
*   Ability to make extensive use of proprietary in-house systems, databases, and data flow control systems.
*   Must be comfortable diving in to existing code bases to understand what they do and make enhancements;
*   Interest and ability to learn other coding languages, as needed;
*   Strong programming skills and obsessive attention to detail;

## Company Size and Health





The company's business model is innovative and produces true value. As the effectiveness of traditional mass marketing (tv, radio, print) declines, companies increasingly turn to innovative, smart providers like PINCHme to gain valuable insights from users in their target markets.

*   Data monetisation revenue up 136% to USD 4.1m (AUD 5.7m)

PINCHme is building one of the largest and most profiled consumer databases in the US in a very efficient way, by giving away free product samples, in exchange for members‚Äô first party data.

PINCHme‚Äôs community growth is highly correlated to the volume of samples distributed on a monthly basis, creating a very strong network effect ‚Äì more samples, more members, more members, more data, more data, more monetisation. This is the reason why the company's immediate focus is not on profitability - they are intelligently trying to win the network effects race.

# Software Engineer for Top Hedge Fund

Our clients request that we not advertise their name in the search. You're a smart developer; you could probably reverse engineer and figure out who this is and apply directly. The benefit of working with us is that we will coach you through the interview process, we will fly you to NYC if you are selected for an on-site, and if you qualify for a role with us you will likely qualify for others.

## About the Employer

Our client was ranked as one of the world's top hedge funds to work for in 2018\. They have over $100 billion in assets under management, and net revenues of over $400 million. They are one of the world's largest hedge funds and the most profitable by some measures. They manage endowment funds for _countries._ They employ over 2 thousand people and having this company on your resume will likely be an exponential increase in your work history pedigree.

The company is committed to their ideals of metitocracy. It has dedicated diversity professionals reporting directly to the C suite, several community groups with the goal of supporting/building diverse communities, and a senior Diversity Council empowered to drive forward the vision for a more vibrant, inclusive community.


## Company Mission


Our client's mission is to bring idea meritocracies to the world, in other words, organizations in which the best ideas win. Humans are naturally and historically poor at decision making, and the costs are high: opportunities squandered, businesses wrecked, people hurt. Why? Human ego, frailty, and bias. The company has set out to systemize a better way for people to work together, to build strong and vibrant communities, and ultimately to achieve world class results. They equip people with the ability to understand one another, thoughtfully disagree, stress test ideas, and compound knowledge through objective decision making.

By collecting streams of real time experimental and observational data from a large and ever-growing number of sources, they construct and fit statistical, machine learning, and optimization models of people and of work. The company attempts to answer questions like: how do we know what people are like? Who is best for a given job? How can we work together more effectively?

## Tech Stack

The tech stack is basically the 2018-2019 gold standard for front end engineering, with a sprinkle of pragmatism and functional programming in the back end:

*   TypeScript
*   Scala
*   REST
*   GraphQL
*   WebSockets
*   React
*   Redux
*   RxJS

## Open Position: Software Engineer

We are looking for passionate, driven people who are interested in helping to usher in a new age of machines and humans working together for better decision making. The team you will be joining is a part of one of the most successful hedge funds in the world. You will be brushing elbows with some of the most brilliant engineers, mathematicians, and quants in the world. It is an exciting learning environment.

### Job Duties:

*   Prototyping, developing, productionalizing, and maintaining systems at all levels of the stack
*   Iterating with users, stakeholders, and engineers on all aspects of an application‚Äôs design
*   Collaboration with other team members to craft quality technical solutions in an open way
*   Working with engineering leaders to design & implement scalable, resilient system architectures

### Qualifications:

*   Expertise in Server Side and/or Client Application Engineering
*   Expert knowledge of the JVM, Java,and ideally Scala
*   Some technological overlap with our stack: React, Redux, TypeScript, GraphQL
*   Familiarity with some search, persistence, and caching tools: Kafka, Spark, Ignite/Redis, ElasticCache, PostgreSQL
*   Knowledge of design patterns: microservices, CQRS, event sourcing, reactivity and streaming
*   Exposure to DevOps: continuous integration, automated testing, cloud deployments, etc.
*   Bonus if expertise with machine learning, data science, or a math & statistics background

2xuiv,alepz7,[Hiring] DevOps Engineer,"Apply here https://codefor.cash/offprice-retail-devops

Off-price retail is when retailers sell branded or designer items to consumers at significantly lower prices than full-price stores.

Our client is a tech platform that retailers and brands can use to connect with one another and purchase inventory. The platform manages the brokerage of millions of dollars of off-price retail transactions. They are providing efficiency to the retail market by creating an online off-retail marketplace that connects brands with off-retail stores.

Our client has world class design and engineering teams. The DevOps engineer will collaborate with them to leverage software and create an elegant UX. You will have the opportunity to be a part of iterative development, from compiling and vetting specifications through integration and testing. You will help build a product that is solving a real-world problem, and which brands and retailers will use every day.

Company Size and Health
The company has raised a total of over $36M in 4 rounds, and they have over $2M revenue.

The client is headquartered in NYC, and they have fewer than 50 employees. It's a startup with ample opportunities for career growth.

Tech Stack
Our client relies on AWS for the hosting of their web services, and they use some PaaS AWS components as well.
AWS: EC2, RDS, Lambda
Docker
Laravel
Node
Php
PostgreSQL
React
Redis
Git

Market Size
Off-price retail is growing faster than any retail sector. Brands have excess product that they are unable to sell at full-price (or even at a slight discount) in stores, and in order to have proper cash flow and be successful in business, they have to sell off this inventory. They typically look to off-price retailers to purchase their product at 40-60% discounts off of the wholesale price, usually taking whatever they can get for their unwanted goods. Excess inventory can occur for many reasons, such as cancelled orders, off-season product, overproduction, manufacturing errors, among other things, and is inevitable in the retail industry.

There is the common notion that retail is dying, but the reality is that department stores are dying, not retail. A 2017 report by JP Morgan seems to indicate that the lion's share of market losses that the department store sector is experiencing are becoming gains for off price retailers.

Job Opportunity: DevOps Engineer

Designing, building and managing the infrastructure on AWS.

2xuiv,akcbrc,[Hiring] Jr. to Mid UI Engineer for an NYC startup,"Apply here https://codefor.cash/fintech-ui

Our client is an NYC startup on a mission to revolutionize the outdated mortgage industry by letting people shop, compare, and close on any mortgage from any lender, completely online. Purchasing a home is the largest, most important financial transaction of most people‚Äôs lives. Getting a mortgage should be just as simple, modern, and transparent as buying anything else online. Our client is building the first-ever fully digital marketplace to make this possible - Kayak, but for mortgages.

Market Size
The US has a total mortgage debt of $10.3 trillion. In 2017 alone, there were $1.75 trillion in new mortgages generated. And these are all being handled by ancient companies running stone age tech, even though 75% of mortgage holders report that they would use an online platform to get their mortgages if one was available.

A Reuters Report indicates that 95% of ATM Swipes still rely on COBOL code. In case you didn't know, COBOL is a dead programming language from the 70s. The costs of these astronomical inefficiencies are being passed down to you, the consumer. Our client is working to disrupt that market and bring it into the 21st century.

Company Size and Health
Founded by a diverse team of mortgage industry vets and software engineers, our client has raised over $11M from Thrive Capital, Lerer Hippeau, Techstars and other well-known investors to completely reinvent the mortgage process, empower consumers and democratize mortgages.

If you fill a responsibility vacuum well, you will most likely get promoted into that role, and you can keep that going until you rise to the C suite.

With $3m in funding and a very small team, this company is a place where your future is in your own hands

## Summary

Our client is a vertically integrated ecommerce company that is changing how parents shop for kids clothes. The founders were previously senior executives at an e-commerce company that had a very successful exit, acquired by Amazon for $545M.

Our client has their sights set on transforming a $30B industry that has seen little innovation in the last 50 years. They are venture backed, and building a team of superstars with significant experience across e-commerce, apparel, and technology. They launched in March 2015 to overwhelming press, customer response and sales momentum (more than doubling revenue every quarter) and are on the way to building an amazing brand that can be part of millions of people‚Äôs lives.

We are looking for passionate, driven people who are interested in helping to build the company from the beginning.

## A Good Story

This company saw its inception when the founders noticed that there was a gap in the market as they were trying to buy clothes for their children. It was born out of passion to deliver an e-commerce apparel experience that is superior from the perspective of the parents and the kids alike.

## Company Size and Health

Savvy devs think like an investor. You can learn new things and meet new people working at any new job. You will learn significantly more, build a stronger network, and accelerate your career trajectory much faster by joining a successful, growing startup.

This startup currently has in the range of \~50 employees. The only way to have a steep career trajectory is by either founding your own successful startup or by joining one. Successful startups grow much faster than they can hire good talent, so naturally there are always opportunities for you to pick up slack and provide additional value if you are so inclined. If you fill a responsibility vacuum well, you will most likely get promoted into that role, and you can keep that going until you rise to the C suite.

With over $27m in funding and explosive revenue growth, this startup is poised to be a place where many people will experience a meteoric rise in their career.

The founding team also enjoys better access to capital than most startups; they secured their first round of funding (a multi million dollar round) within less than a year after the inception of the idea.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack strikes a good balance between being modern and with wide job market applicability:

* Ruby on Rails
* JavaScript
* React
* AWS
* Postgresql
* RSpec

## Market Size

In 2017, the global childrens apparel market was $203 billion in size. Our client has experienced explosive, exponential growth by focusing on the US only, so the opportunities are enormous even if the market were to not grow.

But that's not likely to be the case... Apparel retail in general is going through a tectonic shift in consumer preferences. Brick and mortar titans are either failing or strained with razor thin margins and ballooning operating costs. Where there is chaos, there is opportunity.

## Core Values

We believe that simplicity is beautiful and inspires creativity. That clothes made for kids should be fit for kids, always comfy and never fussy. That words and actions are far more expressive than any slogan or cartoon character. That blue isn‚Äôt for boys and pink for girls. That everyone deserves to feel happy and confident in their clothes. That kids shouldn‚Äôt be judged by what they‚Äôre wearing or not wearing. Because it‚Äôs what‚Äôs inside that counts.

2uhl6,a0pgmd,Paint me a Picture -- what does a childhood and raising a family look like in a dense city?,"I've been raised my whole life to have a whole set of beliefs around what one 'must' do once they have kids. Move to the suburbs, live in a big house with a backyard, get a car, etc., and that not doing so is impossible or impossibly 'selfish'.

&#x200B;

Embarrassingly, I've only recently realized that I might actually have a *choice*. I'm not currently ready to have a baby, but I'd like to and plan to have a family in the future. I know, rationally, that people have been forced or chosen to live in (dense!) cities for a long, long time with their families, so I'm not sure how or why I'd never truly considered it as an option before (actually, I do: constant cultural references; family background, etc.). Given this is a whole subreddit of families living in a city, can you put my mind at ease and explain how this 'works'? It's still somehow an unfathomable choice to me, so I'd really benefit and appreciate it being normalized. What does family life, community, and childhood 'look' like in a city? I grew up spending hours outside riding around, walking to and meeting friends at parks, and generally exploring the neighborhood in elementary school, but it don't think it'd be safe to allow elementary-aged children to do this in a city. How do you handle city schools, or a city's higher concentration of people on drugs, dangerous people in general, etc.?

2zkb5,e05t0n,Social Anxiety Survey," Hey Everyone! I am a second-year Digital Media graduate student at Drexel University, PA. Since I have social anxiety disorder I decided to do something with it for my thesis, So I am creating a 2D animated video on Social Anxiety Disorder. To do that I need to get some information about how people who have SAD react to certain situations(since I cannot use just my experiences). I have created a small survey that would help me a lot. The survey is not just for people with SAD, its for everyone. Please take a moment to help me. Thank you so much.

2zkb5,d8c711,22 year old who suffered from social anxiety and depression his entire life. I finally conquered it.,"Had trouble making friends, holding basic conversations, feared to be the center of attention, constantly felt like a person I was talking to was reading my mind when we made eye contact, could not stay in the moment, my mind filled with insecurities and negative ""voices"" every waking moment. Let's not even mention trying to approach girls.

After trying out different things and working hard on it the past 5 years, I finally got over what I thought I'd be stuck with the rest of my then miserable life. I wish someone was there to tell me how to go about managing and curing SAD when I was still young and had plenty of opportunities ahead of me, that I then missed because of my illness.

I decided to help others who are still struggling and are unable to reach their full potential because of it. I want to help you skip over all these years I had been trying to figure out what's wrong with me and then how to fix it. I always dreamt about helping people with this affliction as I know how difficult and how miserable it makes your life from the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep day after day.

After thinking about it for a while I decided to start my own website with various content (articles only for now - might expand in the future) about my experiences, summaries of the information and scientific papers about sad, depression and mental health, in general, I read over the years and ways of managing and ultimately crushing it.

The website is called [sadbuster.info](https://sadbuster.info)

This is the first time I've decided to write and post publicly so your feedback would be extremely welcome. If you like any of the articles please let me know, and if you want to see more and on any specific topic shoot me a PM or comment here/on the website and I will see what I can do.

2zkb5,3emg7y,Need a date for Diner en Blanc on Tuesday,"Found this via /r/NYC and am amazed this subreddit exists.

Mid-twenty-something guy with tickets to Diner en Blanc this Tuesday; last year I went with a good female friend last year but she isn't available to go. 

I want to go again and don't know anyone else I feel comfortable asking. 

Although I wouldn't rule anything out, I am not looking for a girlfriend/etc... just someone who enjoys cooking/laughs at stupid jokes/would want to dress in all white and go have dinner in a public place in Manhattan on Tuesday at ~5:30. Meeting place I'm assigned to is in Manhattan. The only thing I would ask is that in talking to other people that we would say we met through a friend/by our kayaks colliding in the Hudson river (just not on reddit) and that you be comfortable at least having a glass of champagne in front of you and doing a toast (that was a thing last year and I assume it is again).

I'm not trying to recreate what I had in college cause that was the past and I'm trying to live my life in the moment and not the past.

I just want a group of friends who I can trust, hang around, and live this life with while exploring, going on adventures, and experiencing everything around us and absorbing it all in.

2zkb5,2u9k8i,Game of Thrones IMAX ticket for the hard core fans among us. (See attached),"I have two tickets to Game of Thrones IMAX tomorrow at 7:30pm in Time Square. I originally had a friend visiting me from out of town but she bailed on me earlier today. I've been asking around my program but it seems everyone is busy. I'm still waiting to hear from one person by tomorrow morning at the latest, but should know for sure if they are available by then. 

It's a little odd to ask for a person to go with me online without knowing them, but there are so few of us here it seems appropriate. I'm busy for the rest of the night after this screening, but I will know at least by tomorrow morning if the ticket is available. 

I know it's not an ideal place but it was the only theater in the city playing it. The seats are reserved so we don't have to get there early, and they are midway through the theater in the center. The two episodes that will screen are the last two of Season 4, and then the trailer for Season 5. 

Let me know via comment if you're interested, and I would prefer if you are actually a hard core fan instead of someone who just wants to see a few episodes. These episodes would be a huge spoiler if you haven't seen the series, and I'm not really big on sitting through screenings explaining everything that's happening on screen.

2zkb5,1z64jo,Seattleite with anxiety here. Just got back from a week in NYC that changed my life.,"Hey everyone. I'm a 36/M that is long term unemployed and suffering from severe depression and anxiety from not being able to find a job. A little over a month ago I decided that I'd had enough of life and wanted to see NY before I died, so I sold my car and booked a train ticket. Pretty ballsy for someone who had begun having a hard time walking to the store without sweating and panicking, but hey. 

I've got all kinds of crazy stories about my travels but long story short, I learned a few things that helped me: NYC is so huge that I disappeared. No one remembers my face or anything about me. You know how there's a nice ramp down to the L platform at 8 and 14th? Well, I took the stairs. With luggage. And I guarantee no one gave a crap. It was nice. Seattle is comparatively so sleepy that I would have been on the news. 

Secondly, Central Park. I can't tell you how peaceful it was to walk across the park at 72nd St. The silence. The horse-drawn carriages. The insane joggers. It was a beautiful respite from the GO GO GO of the city, despite the temperature. 

Thirdly, if you act like a New Yorker, you'll fit in just fine. This helped me so much. I had heard ""fake it until you make it"" so many times that I was sick of it, but at the end of the day all you have to do is wear a pea coat, anticipate the ""walk"" signal, and stand to the right to answer a text. When I arrived in Manhattan I was terrified of everything and had no idea of where I was headed or where I needed to go. After a few days, I was answering questions from tourists that had no idea that I lived in Seattle. I live in a ""remote"" part of Seattle that doesn't get a whole lot of tourists, so it was nice to be able to flex my travel muscle. Give it a shot sometime. Manhattan is fucking terrifying to the newcomer, and help is always welcomed. 

Fourthly, I want to see if anyone needs help and would like a roommate. After 14 years I think I'm done with Seattle. So anyway, if you'd like some companionship from someone who knows what you're going through, hit me up. I'd love to come back to NY.

2t7mx,fj6fpn,Next Class & Covid-19,"Apologies for the lengthy post in advance. If you have a minute read on...

Currently The Rock is officially closed until further notice. That means No hazmat classes, no training (drilling) & no probie school until further notice (we don't know how long). It may be 30 days it may be 90. The city is currently in a reactive state Nobody knows for sure what's going to happen next. If anyone tells you they do tell them to put it in writing and give you the Powerball numbers while their at it.

What I can say is this is a pandemic. 
Don't down play it and act as if it's not serious. It is. Their are enough probies in your list that will fail the pulmonary test that don't even know they have pulmonary problems (Imagine being that person).
Do all of your parents tell you everything about their health? 

Your fellow Probies are affected (maybe even you), Your grand parents are affected, your parents may be and in turn even if your healthy You will be affected

Stay humble yes the media is hyping it up and causing a shortage in supplies but that's because they need ratings also and the news stopped being about independent journalism years ago. With that being said that does not mean it's not serious.

Take this serious this is your pre academy time to help others. Everyone says they want to help others, so help others. Everything I'm reading is about people worrying about themselves that's not what the job is about *we're doing EMS runs some companies without N95's at this point*. *Let that sink in*... what are you really ready to do for someone you don't know? 

*It is highly unlikely that a list will be thrown out over this pandemic* with that being said You will get called if you were in for the next class even if it gets pushed back. *The only people that may not make it is the people who had a shot at the tail end of the list*. In that case theirs nothing that can be done and understand things happen. No it won't be extended because DCAS has a system in place for the next list / test and that won't change because of Covid-19
And those people from that list will start right after the current expiration date of this list. It's just the way things go. Nothing is gauranteed until your sworn in *don't quit your job until admin day*.

 Run errands for your seniors buy groceries etc. Set an example. The truth is most probies say the minute they enter probie school their community looks at them differently. That may or may not be true but holds some truth to it & you don't have to wait until you reach probie school to realize this. My take is, that's the pride of those around them finally being noticed.
Putting on a probie jacket isn't what shows your community your the pride of that community, that comes from what your willingness to do for others.

This isn't about mass Hysteria. It's about people staying away from each other in hopes that we can all let this virus pass and once the numbers are low enough get back to our normal lives. Sometimes we have to go through things to grow in the right direction.

Nobody on the job wants to deal with this. We are low in N95's my company has been out for days the city will say what they want, we are not realistically prepared for this. In some areas we can't get Clorox to Decon the Firehouse... Hospitals in Long Island & Upstate are being over run by patients they don't have enough staff or beds to treat. The nature of the runs have become more dangerous because now we are low on ppe & become potential carriers of this virus and can infect a full FH and in turn their entire families (same goes for EMS). 

Explain to your family members Only call 911 if it's an emergency and you seriously need assistance. Diarrhea, falling off of your bed onto your carpet and being drunk are not emergencies. You'd be surprised the ridiculous calls EMS & Fire see on a daily basis. Which is why the city cut back on sending Fire on non emergency EMS runs, it's a waste of resources imagine using 7x N95 mask Vs using 2x N95 per non emergency EMS runs. It's not about who does what jobs EMS is not expected to help repack a hoseline after a üî•. Nor is EMS asked to help throw up a ladder at a fire for us. Our jobs are equally important And yet entirely different and co dependant, point proven when Fire is asked to show up to lift patients up and down stairs and onto an ambulance for perfectly capable EMTs.
Fire is still being dispatched on EMS runs as we should be just to the more serious emergencies that require more hands on the patient. It's not being selective on who we send but Fire can't do anything for someone with Diarrhea or with a hangover we don't transport patients but *we can save a life of someone who just had a heart attack*( that's a serious emergency) or apply a tourniquet to someone who just lost a leg at 2am working on their car on the side of a highway (yes it happens more often than you think. Slow down throw your hazards on & drive on the rim if you have to, but get off the highway if you have to work on your car)

*(Back to Covid-19)*

People need to Stop hoarding supplies this is not a zombie apocalypse, this is Not Raccoon City.
You do Not need an N95 while driving alone in your car. Wash your hands and stay a safe distance away from each other. Limit any gatherings.

People do need to stay home, stay away from each other and take precautions to stay healthy. Kids are carriers but seem to be unaffected showing little to no symptoms, but carries still can infect their families. The idea is currently to keep people home Not waste our resources (N95, Toilet paper, Alcohol, hand sanitizer, Clorox etc) and then move on.

*(Back to the Academy)*

If all you care about is getting into the academy then take this time to start setting records and showing it when you get to the academy. I can't stress it enough Their is No reason... Do not show up under prepared.

If your run was struggling take this time to add more to your run. Pick an object in your line of sight then one further ahead go from a light jog to a Sprint back to a light jog do this for about 3 miles at your own pace it'll knock off crucial seconds to your run. 
If you think your a good runner start running on sand for a distance and stay humble.
Do push ups at red lights (if your in an area you can) and sit ups during commercial breaks at home.

I definitely am somewhat to blame for that - I'm the only mod here, and I don't check out this sub as often as I should.

However, it's important to note, once again, that this is a PUBLIC FORUM. That means ANYBODY - the job, the media, civilians, kids looking for more information about becoming a firefighter, etc, can all see what is posted here.

This is not the kitchen table at the firehouse. Treat this subreddit like you would treat a civilian you're giving a tour of the firehouse to. The job has its issues, like every single other job out there - would you spend that tour badmouthing the department to that civilian? Would you insult that civilian if they asked what you thought was a ""bad"" question about the job, how to get on, or what is expected of a firefighter?

The majority of people in this sub are people on the list, waiting to be called. To everybody who is on the job now - we were ALL in their shoes at one point, and we were all itching to get as much information we could regarding when we could get on the greatest job on Earth and what we could expect. The jobs unwritten rules are not intuitive - you learn by messing up, and every single person on this job has messed up at some point. Remember that before you insult someone.

To everyone who is waiting to be called - the members that are on here are giving you advice on their own time, out of the goodness of their hearts, to help you out. Every person has had a different experience on this job, and so you're going to hear a lot of different advice, and it may not be the advice you were expecting or want to hear. Sometimes things don't translate well online - don't always assume the worst. Being rude and dismissive is not a trait that will serve you well in this department.

2t7mx,ftadmz,Covid-19 FDNY / EMS Academy updates.,"So the job is currently experiencing something that's never happened in the history of the job and more things are changing.

Currently members (FF's) that came out of the promotional exam and all members that have a valid current EMS certifications (kept them up to date for side work, personal reasons etc) are being asked to start manning EMS Ambulances. This is a pilot program and may continue into the foreseeable future. This means members are being taken from the Fire side to cover the EMS side being that the EMS side is critically over worked at this point.

(Members OTJ can confirm by checking their UFA emails.)

The EMS side has always been critically under staffed and consistently loses a huge amount of member on each promotional exam.

The word has been that the promotional exam was going away. It's been rumored for a while but after hearing some stuff today... I believe that more now.

That's not necessarily a bad thing. The silver lining is that EMS is in everybodies eyes right now they're front and center showing everyone who didn't know, just how invaluable of a resource they truly are.

Not right now but soon after:
I do expect EMS to finally get the compensation we've been fighting for, for our brothers and sisters on the EMS side.

EMS will have a spotlight I do believe (from what I have access to) the hiring process for EMS will be crucial in the months after this Pandemic and the city will focus first and foremost on fully and efficiently staffing EMS.

With that being said expect for the department to want to start wanting to **retain** the members they're putting crucial training into and pouring tons of money into (EMS Trainee's, etc). 

**This is a NOT a direct or official message from the department I do NOT speak for the FDNY.** 
This is news being heard through the pipeline, just figured I'd pass down the useful information that's being put out their.

What does that mean for processing FD Candidates? Hopefully Nothing. 
**However** EMS will be a strong focal point going forward for the department, not saying Fire won't be but expect EMS to finally get the push they deserve. Keep that in mind.

With that said if your taking the EMS exam with no desire for the EMS job don't be surprised if you find the promotional exam no longer an option real soon. After all nobody really takes that job just for the promotional exam right?
Just know that the city will be looking into a better compensation package for those members very soon after this is all over

2t7mx,fofc9r,All Candidates Please Read: New regulations Going forward.,"Long post. Apologies in advance.
Lots of information & a new direction for this thread.

I recently join on as a mod and we've had a really long conversation as to what would benefit candidates, future candidates and the members on the job.

We understand candidates want to share information and data. The mods have spoken and we agreed this is Not the platform for such information sharing. 

This platform is open to the public any members on the job have access to read EVERY comment posted. With that being said most members OTJ want to provide constructive & useful information few come on here to argue.

We cannot control what members comment on while on this forum. As you all know 1 of the rules of the job ""no news is good news"", the FDNY as a whole does not want negative publicity ever being put out there or any public arguments among members / non members & we do a good job in putting our best face forward (Remember this for your entire career). 

*Respecting that rule we do see a need to respectfully distance candidates & candidates information and this FDNY Reddit thread (explained below)*

Honestly I was shocked when I looked at how many members are currently banned from this thread daily for whatever reason (that alone is a huge job for the mods/admins) and to be honest theirs So many people that still need to be banned from this thread but it's extremely difficult to keep up with to keep the peace.

Most Candidates on here have been respectful and said encouraging things to each other. That's a great attitude to have & I encourage you to keep up that enthusiasm.

 *However*  their are some Candidates that are only complaining about their current status or the status of the world and some are just here to troll and argue. This doesn't look good to the public, to members at HQ (I can tell you theirs more than enough people from HQ on this forum) and to our current members on the job who are unfortunately formulating an opinion based on whats being posted here. That's not what we the mods or the members that have your back want for anyone coming into this job. Please respect this decision. This will be your resource once you graduate but we can't let this thread become a out bickering. Keep in mind under no circumstances should you ever argue with someone that has more time OTJ than you (kindly prove them wrong and prove your right), you should always respect a members time OTJ regardless of personal opinions.

Remember shaving your head for the academy is symbolic it's about you putting your best face forward and saying you are not an individual. However theirs too many people on here asking individual and personal questions. Some questions have been asked that the general public don't need to have the answers to (I won't respond as to which).

We can't control what You post. But we can control what's associated to the FDNY on this forum.

**If Your are currently Not a Sworn in FDNY member on the Job and are currently on a list we encourage you to use the following site:**

https://forums.firehouse.com/forum/careers-training/hiring-employment-discussion/2069906-fdny-exam-7001/page187

This is more of a private forum that the general public does not follow and most members on the job have no interest in following. The format is much more beneficial to You the Candidate, information is posted page after page and the same repetitive questions are much less likely to be asked. Keep in mind getting all the information posted here on Reddit requires You to read each and every post in order to take in all the information. This is a legit invaluable Candidate Resource

If you want to do some homework and read up on the previous class's forum:

We understand use of this thread may go down but we want to continue to use this forum for what it was intended for:

FDNY News, Events, Contract News, Motivational information for non members *asking basic questions*, Line Of Duty Deaths & line up locations (everyone's invited to attend), and of course Buff's sharing pictures of jobs and our companies etc, this thread should Never be used for sensitive information.

We appreciate the Candidates that came to this thread with great intentions and wish you a the best of luck. I will continue to follow your journey and check in from time to time to provide any info I can on the FH Forum.

2t7mx,flnyot,Next Academy & what's going on update,"Their will be no April Academy.

The Rock will officially remain closed until further notice. All instructors who are able bodied along with  any bosses currently at HQ (who are not crucial to HQ) are required back in the field until further notice.

For the most part we're all out of N95's and this thing hasn't even peaked. We're expecting a large amount of infected members and need all of the man power in the field. Nobody knows where the end of the list would be or what the last list # will be. The only people who might possibly be affected are at the tail end of the list who for the most part have not even started training or may have never been called in the first place. Keep in mind only 1 class is currently scheduled to be delayed.

*Their is no idea what part of the list is the end. 
But It's all relative.*

Some will fail CPAT, some will fail the medical & Psych. Some people will quit on the run date and never show up for admin day. Some will quit during the academy, *don't be this person*

If you quit during the academy or show up under prepared you will take a spot from someone at the end of the list. If you are not prepared or have a life event coming defer until your ready. This is the only time you have full control of your career, you will Not lose your place on the list if you defer early on.

Some people will differ for a life changing event like having a kid, getting married, or losing a loved one all of which need time and dedication to get over or get through.
Some will differ because of military service.
Some get paid to much at their current job and might not take this job. 
And more than enough people are not seriously interested and only took the test to see if they can pass (You passed congrats now make a serious choice).
Theirs no reason to be questioning things this far in.

Understand what's going on outside is not going on the harm your odds at getting in. Things happen. This was unforseen and we have bigger things on our plate other than probie school (no offense).

*My own estimate going off of the facts I currently am aware of*:
Realistically if our peak for Covid-19 is in 45 days you can expect this to blow over in 90 days at which point they'll start processing again & instructors should be returning back to The Rock. If this runs according to this then you can expect a class possibly by July / August... The bright side is August tends to be the hottest month so the rest of the academy should be great weather. 

*Variables*
They can start earlier than August.
Tons of variables still exist that can potentially balance out the tail end of the list and not affect those at the end. Everyone stay level headed nothing is written in stone.

Do not write yourself off yet. When this blows over (and it will) Theirs going to be tons of people that are going to try to do the right thing to balance the list and push for that 1 more class.

Anyone having this problem with residency credits?

I'm list number 10XX for test 7001. I got a 98 plus 5 points for residency.

I've lived in NYC since 2006, except for two years of Grad School upstate.

The problem: CID is asking for tax returns from 2014 and 2015- the two years I was at school.

My driver's license, previous license (issued 2014), NYC ID (issued 2015), voting registration, credit card statements, hospital records, bicycle tickets (from 2015), W2 forms and utility bills (I kept my NYC apartment through school) these are all in NYC. I've spent 11 of the last 13 years in NYC.

My list number hasn't changed yet, but my investigator told me I won't be getting the 5 points, and most likely won't get on the job at all.

(Also: I did not originally claim the residency credit on the exam - I was contacted by a representative of the FDNY and told to appeal, which I did at that point. The points were added, and now they're being removed)

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Still no luck. I sent in an appeal to both DCAS and the FDNY, both appeals denied. Talked briefly to a lawyer who said there is no real recourse. I know another guy who will be hiring a lawyer and trying to push further.

I did decently well on the written exam, I was going to the CPAT training sessions at the Rock, I passed the physical with minutes to spare. I got the run down etc. I was organizing my life around entering the academy in the next year. Then my investigator told me I would lose the residency points- and a full investigation would not be done. Feels like a door closed in my face. I understand the rules got more specific, but it's frustrating.

The problem is that I'll be above the age limit by the next test. I took the exam prior to 7001, but I didn't do well that time.

2t7mx,czss6d,Questions on getting diagnosed with ADD before medical and financial stability on starting pay,"Hey all,

While waiting on the next steps of the firefighter hiring process, I was wondering about a few things and would love some insight from people who have already been there/done that.

1)  Currently I have nothing on my medical record to indicate anything but I strongly suspect that I would be diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD) of the inattentive variety if I were to consult a doctor to get an official diagnosis.  Now while I certainly believe that I can handle this job without medication (I have gone my whole life without taking anything for it)  I ideally would like to be the best version of myself for this job.  However, I am very concerned about the FDNY getting worried about it in the background/medical part of the hiring process.  Am I shooting myself in the foot if I get officially diagnosed and get prescription medication before the background/medical?  What about after that?  I would like to get officially diagnosed but I'd rather not be disqualified if it comes down to it.  I believe I technically can't be disqualified from being diagnosed but if they want me out, I'm sure the FDNY will find a way lol.

2) Once in the academy and onwards, how difficult is it to make ends meet?  Is the starting pay enough to pay off bills and everything while living in/near the city without struggling immensely or should I expect to pick up a second job?  ~$45,000 a year is enough/more than enough in most places but NYC is pretty expensive to live in so I'm really not sure what to expect.

Need some advice. So I'm 25 years old and I have recently left my job to return to school and due to unfortunate academic reasons I will not be returning for the following semester and will return back to my hometown NYC. Lately, I've been thinking about pursuing to become a firefighter so I went through their website and saw that it requires a written exam offered every couple of years. It doesn't say specifically when the next exam will be and I'm having a hard time finding the schedule for the next exam. That being said, if I were to begin the process of becoming a firefighter, and because of the age limit is 29 as well as the length of the process, is it too late to become one? Are there any recommendations you have to speed the process up as well? Here is some background info:

2t7mx,butcwy,"Bizarre experience with local station removing a bike lock, can anyone help?","I called my local Brooklyn firehouse because I had locked my bike inside my apartment building to a railing and lost my only key. I'm an idiot, but that's besides the point.

So a truck shows up with five dudes and they all get out to check out the lock. They try using a hand operated cutter on the lock itself but that doesn't work. One of them asks his supervisor if they should use a saw to cut the lock open, but instead the supervisor says they should just cut the railing the bike is attached to off. So they cut the railing and I can remove the bike, but obviously my ulock is still attached to my bike - so basically I have the same problem I had before calling them except now my super has a broken railing. One firefighter says they can cut the lock off my bike outside so I go outside with them. They pack up for a minute or two and then another firefighter says they can't cut the lock off my bike and then they leave.

Can anyone explain what happened or why they chose to do things this way? I'm very confused. I can't tell if they were trying to make my day worse on purpose or if they genuinely thought they were helping. I had a similar lock situation last year and they sawed the lock off with some sort of angle grinder without damaging any property - it took about a minute as compared to the twenty minutes this call took.",,False,0.6,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FDNY/comments/butcwy/bizarre_experience_with_local_station_removing_a/

Am I still proud of my shitty coat/helmet/gear? Yes, but a couple of things have changed my perspective lately. First, I'm tired of going to funerals. I'm a 9/11 guy and it physically hurts every time I go to a 9/11 funeral. Most of them cancer. And the more info we get about the carcinogins that we carry on salty gear, it seems we have a greater chance of getting cancer. How do explain to my kids that I had a chance to lower the risk, but I chose to look all crusty. Secondly, I'm a boss for awhile now,  Am I doing the younger generation a favor by perpetuating that image? Will they follow my lead? Am I influncing them to make decisions that will hurt them in the end?

I do know the job is working on some of these answers for us. We have a BC who is very knowledgeable about this and he swears we're not doing ourselves right by walking around with dirty contaminated gear.

So I'm currently looking into the possibility of obtaining a firefighting job elsewhere for a few years so I can both be sure that this is what I want and that I can hit the ground running when I get called by the FDNY.

I plan on volunteering at my local fire department to obtain the necessary certs and get some experience but I'd really like to transition to a paid position elsewhere after six months or so, especially since I will have to quit my current job due to traveling too much to be a reliable volunteer.  Is the job market highly competitive for firefighting or is it easy enough to get hired if you have the necessary certs, some volunteer experience and a good attitude?

I am definitely willing to relocate to another region of the US for a job.  I assume places like California are begging for more people, right?  Can entry level firefighters make enough to be financially self sufficient?  Am I making a smart move or shooting myself in the foot by taking a lower paying job so I can gain experience volunteering so I have a shot at applying to other jobs?

2t7mx,9u6a2d,taking a big gamble on my plan to become a firefighter - please tell me my odds of this working out,"It's mostly a question about time.

&#x200B;

I will turn 29 years old in January 2021. I missed my opportunities to take the open competitive exams for firefighting, the last of which was in 2017. Since that test is typically given every 4 years, it looks like the next one will be in 2021 (right?) but since I turn 29 at the beginning of that year it looks unlikely that I'll be able to take it.

&#x200B;

So, I applied to be an EMT Trainee a few days ago. From my understanding, the promotional exam for EMT to Firefighter is given every 2 years - and since the last one was given earlier this year (and the last one before that in 2016), it looks like the next one will be in 2020. I will be 28 y/o throughout that year so at first it seemed like I could just take the promotional exam that year BUT I think I also read that I needed to \*have been an EMT for 2 years\* in order to take that exam. So given that it will probably take some time until I am fully and officially an EMT Trainee (and even more time to be an actual non-Trainee \*EMT\* EMT)...let's say, for example, the middle of 2019 (no idea how good this estimate is)...if I take the promotional exam in 2020 (let's say its given in the middle of that year) it appears that I would not have met the requirement (?) of having 2 years of EMT experience. So perhaps I'd waste my time/money on that exam because I'd be disqualified?

&#x200B;

One of the EMTs I work with told me that the 2-year EMT experience won't matter but I wanted to ask on this subreddit for more opinions. Also, I just started working for FDNY as a stockworker (via civil service) a couple months ago so I'm not even finished with my introductory probation year yet. So take that to consideration as well (to whatever extent that is relevant). I figured I should drop the $47 on that EMT Trainee test just in case, while I didn't yet have an answer to how feasible it is for me to become a firefighter that way. It's important for me to know this because I'd be taking a pay cut, changing my job from stockworker to EMT (although apparently I would earn more via overtime?), and I understand that the EMT job itself is going to be a lot more stressful than my current stockworker job. It'll all be worth it \*if\* that EMT job can eventually lead into firefighting. If I learn from you guys that it'll be impossible because of the time limitations/requirements, then I won't pursue the EMT job, and I'll just accept the $47 loss of applying for it, while staying in my current job - and I suppose I'll wait around for the next Conductor, Train Operator or Sanitation Worker exam.

I'm of course not suggesting that the department just equip RDS without any additional training for these specialized units to ease them in to the transition, but as a civilian looking from the outside in, it would seem like the optimal test group to demonstrate the effectiveness of RDS on pistols would be with specialized units, since in theory specialized units would conceivably have faster first and follow up shots on a timer with higher accuracy and precision than the police department at large, and with RDS, those metrics would be demonstrably better.  Taking into consideration the firearm laws of NYC and the demographics of the NYPD, it is reasonable to conclude that the overwhelming majority of recruits will shoot their first firearm at the academy, as most recruits are long time residents of NYC and have no prior military experience. As a result, if RDS can help improve accuracy and precision in a shorter amount of time against static targets, that would leave more time to learn and practice more advanced techniques at academy and this of course would flow back upstream to the department at large over time as veteran officers would return back to academy for accelerated training courses.
2. Since the G34 shares the same frame as the G17, is there any talk about fielding and eventually adopting that platform as well, since the G17 was finally adopted in 2016?
3. This question is purely speculative as Glock (to my knowledge) has not developed a 12 lb trigger spring for the new Gen 5 models, however, assuming they did so for the NYPD (since they did that for the previous generation models), is it LIKELY that the NYPD would eventually adopt almost the entire line of current Glock Gen 5 models (17, 19, 26 models of Gen 4 are currently in the roster in different roles, the 34 and 45 would be the two models up for consideration, with the 45 possibly being a very popular choice, given the civilian sales and popularity of the 19X). 
4. Referencing this [post](https://teamonenetwork.com/2017/05/06/springfield-armorer-courses-at-nypd/), would a recruit, after his probation, be able to volunteer and be selected for this type of training? Would selection be primarily dependent on a willingness to volunteer,  a display of aptitude and/or previously acquired knowledge, or something entirely different?
5. Just out of curiosity, are graduates permitted to practice at the Avenue X and Rodman's Neck Ranges on their own time, assuming the ranges are not in use for official training, or do they have to practice at ranges open to civilians?
6. Finally, and again, I would fully understand if members of the NYPD aren't permitted to answer these questions,  so this is question is a complete shot in the dark but just how far does the range extend at Rodman's Neck for the long guns?   [Det. Tina Guerrero](https://www.fox5ny.com/news/meet-the-nypds-first-female-counter-sniper) remarks during an interview with Fox 5 NY a few years ago that she would start at 100 yards, then 200, then finally 300 and confirm the zero at 100 before going out, but given that platform, is that really the maximum range of Rodman's Neck? Would ESU officers go off the reservation and train at any of the schools (like Sig Sauer Academy) and stretch out that platform properly?

* Are the chaplains' churches, synagogues, etc. their home bases, rather than a particular precinct, and they travel to various precincts to perform their NYPD duties? As opposed to all being housed in one precinct, or being assigned to individual precincts.
* How much time do chaplains spend on their NYPD duties vs. their religious community duties?
* How does one become a chaplain? (I've read by appointment by the police commissioner or mayor, and/or nomination by committee.)

3egkf,f660j7,casual art song recital performance spaces in Manhattan,"(I'm not sure if this is the optimal place to ask but figured I'd try here first; if anyone has any suggestions for other places to ask, I am all ears.)

I am looking for a venue to hold an art song recital in NYC around late April/early May. The performance is casual: my pianist and I are both reasonably serious but amateur musicians, and we are not charging money -- the audience will mostly be our friends.

Necessary parameters: grand piano in good shape, seats \~50, preferably in Manhattan in the ballpark of West Harlem/Morrningside Heights/UWS.

The best option I am aware of now is Opera America, which rents for $155/hour and has a nice space that I've seen before. The drawbacks are that most of our friends live further uptown, and while the price isn't quite so high to be a deal-breaker, it's pushing our budget (2 hours would probably be the bare minimum, and in an ideal world we'd have more time to get settled/warm up/etc. and also get a dress rehearsal in the space).

Does anyone have any other suggestions? I'd be willing (even especially excited) to know about ""non-traditional"" venues.",,False,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCopera/comments/f660j7/casual_art_song_recital_performance_spaces_in/

There was about 60 seconds of complete silence and then 1 person did a slow clap and others joined in. There's also no air-flow in the theatre as it is still being constructed.

First 30 minutes is excruciating because of the reading of punctuation by Ben (Renee's parts in the first third are mostly voice-overs). The next 30 minutes is better because she starts singing but anytime she's not singing I was really bored. The next 15 minutes were actually fantastic I thought. The last 15 minutes were boring, it felt like it needed to end a little earlier.

I love what they did with her voice, the background vocals, etc... but I couldn't help feeling like I was watching a podcast being preformed live on stage. The show was a mess and I think it would have had potential had it been entirely sung through (though the issue with no dialogue would have persisted; the characters aren't really talking to each other and don't have names they're just sort of reciting ""poetry""?).

(1) You are currently holding two family circle tickets for ring cycle #2 at similar value and would be willing to swap for ring cycle #3.

2scvf,fl35zv,Unjerk: Regarding crossposts to this subreddit,"Hi there. 

In case you're wondering who I am: I am a moderator of this subreddit. I apologize for any surprise my existence may cause you. 

Anyway, this subreddit has supported cross-posts for some time, and some of you have been using the feature to, presumably, dunk on people posting stuff in other subreddits that sounds like it belongs in this subreddit. 

The problem is that cross-posting might end up amplifying stuff instead of mocking it. People have recently pointed out that the subreddit has some users who consistently cross-post racist stuff from /r/nyc or /r/AskNYC. I can assume that the cross-posts are in good faith, and that the intent is condemning the racism rather than spreading it, but the former can be indistinguishable from the latter in practice. 

So, I have a request: please consider whether or not cross-posting even vaguely racist stuff into this subreddit really fits, before you do it. Also, I have a question for anyone here: should the subreddit continue to have cross-posts enabled? Before cross-posts, it's never really been a screenshot-dunking subreddit or anything, but now that's what a lot of content is, so, opinions?",moderator,False,1.0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerknyc/comments/fl35zv/unjerk_regarding_crossposts_to_this_subreddit/

Since it‚Äôs been such a long time I went and got her an engagement ring with my parent‚Äôs credit card and I am considering having kids with her and starting a family like I‚Äôve always dreamed of.

My main dilemma is that I would have to upsize my living space. I‚Äôm selling my 2 bedroom co-op on 59th Street and using the money to buy a brownstone in Brooklyn, preferably a corner lot with a storefront so we can make our living selling hand crafted sweaters and sour beers. A three car garage would be nice too. 

That said, I haven‚Äôt been to Brooklyn before and I‚Äôm not sure how safe the Park Slope neighborhood is. I heard it‚Äôs close to the projects and that teenagers there smoke weed and drink beer in Prospect Park for fun. It‚Äôs also dangerously close to Flatbush. I don‚Äôt want my children to wind up getting kidnapped or hooked on drugs by some hoodlums. 

One of my friends told me to move to Forest Hills instead, because it‚Äôs ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù and more ‚Äúspacious.‚Äù  Do I look like a fucking redneck? I might as well just start chewing tobacco, wearing overalls, and shooting deer for fun if I move to *Queens* of all places. The fuck outta here.

2scvf,dgxm7w,Is it time to leave NYC?,"This is my first post on Reddit‚Ä¶ so I'm ready for the comments.

I moved to New York several years ago to achieve the lifelong dream. Working in a ‚Äúhip‚Äù office for a few years, I then took the plunge and went into business for myself. I was in the black for the first two years as an independent contractor, but then the market changed and I quickly went into the red... and I transitioned down a different career path. I have lived in several different metropolises throughout my life, but am tired and rather burnt out from living hand-to-mouth these past couple of years in an attempt to still ‚Äúmake it‚Äù here.

The ‚Äúsexiness‚Äù and ‚Äúlife party‚Äù of New York has dimmed significantly in my eyes, and some days I feel nothing but bitterness and sadness as every inch of this place seems to be covered in scaffolding coupled with the sound of drills, jackhammers, cranes, and trash being thrown into massive bins; ads for awful startups pawning ridiculous crap (hello, perfume subscription services); bank, pharmacy and crappy clothing chain stores on every corner; and the growing monstrosity that is Hudson Yards and Domino Park. Worst of all, it seems like a massive, ‚Äòmonoplex‚Äô playground for the uber-wealthy and tourists ‚Äî whose numbers continue to increase yearly. Not to mention, the subway system is falling apart‚Ä¶ and I used to sing its praises just six years ago. (I use it at least 3-4 times a day.) The conversations I overhear on the subway almost always relate to stress, money, work and busyness. Has it always been this way, or am I just more in tune because it‚Äôs all I can think about as well?

My friends who make decent money here (six figures / single folks in their mid-30‚Äôs) seem to be equally miserable, even though they have jobs with benefits and can afford to live alone. They always seem overwhelmed, fully booked up, and spend quite a lot of money when going out ($50-75 on average) in one go. (Those days are over for me due to budgeting/priorities at the moment.)

I am seriously considering relocating to a different city further north in the next year. I am not sure where just yet, but I miss trees, quiet, cleanliness and ‚Äî dare I say it? ‚Äî being neighborly. However, it is difficult for me to imagine a life outside of New York when I essentially worked in my teenage years and my 20s to get to this point. For me, it's as if I would end up crushing an identity I desperately want to maintain, even though I sometimes feel that time is over. I can‚Äôt say I am miserable every day, but I find myself wanting to be here less and less, even though I have built some strong friendships, a support group for those in the arts (like myself) and even have a couple of family members close by.

People say I can always return to New York if it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt work out‚Äù, but I am not sure if I believe that. If anything, I am feeling a pull toward Portland (Maine) or the Boston area. (I have visited both.) When I mentioned this to a couple of friends, they laughed out loud, mentioned the horrific winters, the lack of diversity, and generally ‚Äúless bang for your buck‚Äù if I relocate. Is it that bad? I see apartments in Portland for $900-1,000 in the arts district and feel the excitement build, but perhaps that‚Äôs just the fantasy run amuck.

To quote The Clash, should I stay or should I go? I am a massive believer in following one‚Äôs heart, and clearly have taken creative risks from time to time, but the older I get, the more realistic I think, and wonder if I should just stick it out until something good comes along (and it invariably does), or take the plunge and move to another city?

2r4vl,f5zn4o,Doubts about an apartment's location area: Between Broadway (G) and Lorimer Street (L),"Hi there!

Long story short, I just moved to NY (first-timer here) and currently searching for an apartment. I'm mainly focusing my searches in Williamsburg and happened to have found a charming place located at Meserole Street. I'm inquiring about the area of Williasmburg between Broadway (G) and Lorimer Street (L) stops (see picture below).

https://preview.redd.it/fne0nm1s7rh41.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a4d1e8d3cbefe0499078073f8e460d8c251061e

Now. From what I've understood, this area of Williamsburg is considered rather residential and calm compared to Prime Williamsburg, where all the fun and action take place and where all the small coffees shops, restaurants and bars are located. Therefore, my questions are:

1. Although on foot I'll only be at a 20-minute distance from Prime Williamsburg, would you recommend to a foreigner who will be staying in NYC for only one year, living in this part of the neighbourhood?
2. Should I keep looking?
3. Is it considered a safe area?

Has anybody else gotten a ticket charge from Revel ($95!!) for parking on N 7th in between Bedford and Berry?

I parked there because there were already like 7 Revels in a row there (I assumed it was like a Revel station? Obviously I'm wrong but I don't think it's that dumb of a guess.). A month later, I got a parking ticket charge from Revel. So I called and asked what's up and they said there are:

200 Revel parking tickets per month in that area right outside the Starbucks! They are taking that strip of N 7th off of the Revel map.

So I tried to get them to offset the cost of my ticket, saying that it's not like all your users don't know how to read signs--with that many Revels in one place, it seems legit to park there. They were definitely not budging.

Because of the NYPD's indifference, Kopach has only faced a low level charge and will likely not see much jail time.  The 94th Precinct's inept actions mean he will unlikely be prosecuted for the constant harassment and death threats he targeted victims with.

I was wondering what fun things there were to do around with a lab (dog parks, anything). A third question would be if anyone knows anything about the area I‚Äôm moving to, I‚Äôd love to know more. I‚Äôve been to Williamsburg but only as a visitor.

They are babies, 6 weeks old...a little bit hissy because we decided they shouldn't live and alley and they should have a nice human family that loves them. But they will be grateful for in the end. But because they are so tiny, their tough gal act is more funny than anything. But they have been with our vet and warming up as they see the advantages of loves and treats and warm beds.  
Here's the litter, Neptune, Mars and Pluto: [https://imgur.com/a/WPcihiU](https://imgur.com/a/WPcihiU)

But - we need someone willing to take them in as roommates until we can post them for adoption and screen the applications and all that. We can bring you some supplies and these little ladies have been vaccinated and treated for anything a kitten can get on the streets (all that good medical stuff!)  
You would be helping to save their little lives - and if you absolutely fall in love and can't part with them - you get first dibs at adopting as long as you will adopt a pair. Trust me, solo kittens don't do as well when they hit 6-9 months and they will lick your nose at 2 AM to get you to play with them. And at that point its harder to introduce them to another cat. We don't do solo kitten adoptions unless there are special circumstances like a young cat already at home, or they get to have their own puppy.  
These ladies are AH-DORABLE. That nose blaze just kills me. If you are interested, send us your deets via the foster app here: [https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/ADVR/Cat](https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/ADVR/Cat)

2r4vl,c0oqyx,Last call for kitten season foster families!," Hello all from AdvoCat Rescue (advocatrescue dot org) based in beautiful Forest Hills NYC! We're recruiting a few more fosters for kitten season. As you may know, May-July all city shelters and rescues get overwhelmed with found kittens. They are born in parks, in garages, behind dumpsters...they are everywhere. And people call us to pick up mama and spay her and find great homes for her and her babies. We get so many people handing off kittens! Its like a kitten cornucopia!

We've had a huge response on reddit (hence the crossposts all over the NYC neighborhood reddits.) We have a few fosters in Williamsburg already.

We are a 501c3 organization, a New Hope Partner of the NYC shelter and a Best Friends Network Partner.

So if you have a little bit of room and want to spend the next three weeks cuddling cute kittens - please let us know! Its super easy. Generally fosters donate food and litter since it isn't the easiest to ship/transport, we can bring you any other supplies (litter box, play pen etc.) We bring kittens to our vet to get vaccinated and checked for worms and all that. And once they are cleared to go, we bring them to you!

[ We are foster kittens Catticus and Picatso! We're gonna get adopted soon! ](https://preview.redd.it/mjx8fa9mpd431.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec6d3bc6787fc8ebd9b80bfb07870700f7ca4414)

 They will generally be with you until about 8 weeks old when they are big enough to go back to the vet and get vaccinated, so they can then go to their forever home.

All you gotta do is show them to potential adopters, but showing cute fuzzy kittens is generally like showing an under market, bright and airy 1 bedroom, 2 blocks from the subway. Its easy and the first people to show up usually say ""I'll take em!""

And if you have pets at home already, even better. I have seen the grumpiest old tom cats melt when a kitten comes home. Of course if you fall in love, you get first dibs!

Send in your basic info and we will totally be in touch.

[https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/ADVR/Cat](https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/foster/ADVR/Cat)

And even if you can't foster - totally follow us on the social medias. We are @AdvoCatRescue pretty much everywhere. We are working with local partner in Forest Hills to put together a fun and boozy fundraiser night - so keep an eye out for that. There may or may not be a cute kitten drinking game involved.

Thank you beautiful people of Brooklyn!

I'm the decision maker for the group and feel overwhelmed with the responsibility of choosing haha I don't mind not having the view as I see it every day on the way to work and at the park, but what about the overall experience? That's where I need help from people who have gone :)

Based on the following, which would you choose for...

* Group of laid back, late 20s women
* We want to enjoy a fun day in the sun with good music and people, but not looking for an over the top ""Spring Break"" vibe

We're volunteering our time, it is of absolutely no cost to donor nor doctor. We are prepared to do this service, healthcare workers are prepared to keep fighting this war, but we NEED your voice.

2qn3w,fcc90s,Looking for 1 more player for long term indi tabletop rpg.,"One of our players is a little hard to contact, so we've decided to open up the group to one more person to bring the numbers up. I'm hoping that this can become a long-running great story. i haven't had a good gaming group in many years.

Originally a french political satire game, In Nomine was translated and adapted to english in the 90s.it's funny, brutal, scary, political, and often takes strange and disturbing turns. it's one of my favorite settings, possibly my favorite modern setting, and i'm putting together a group to play every other wednesday in the lower east side in my apartment (we may also rotate locations).

The game is modern, and the setting focuses mostly on angels and demons who are trying to manipulate the prayers and wishes of humanity without revealing their true natures. I prefer complex parties of mixed loyalties, backgrounds, and fun stories. These are not your typical angels and demons, they are closer to concept elementals and are not very easy to typecast as either good or evil.

i'm in my mid 30s and would prefer to play with gamers on the older side of the age-spectrum. Years ago i games professionally. i'm a little out of practice but still confidant that i can tell a great story. these days i spend my time writing fiction.story and role-play before rules or build. In Nomine is a setting where combat is very rarely the best solution to a problem at hand. LGBT+ are quite welcome. however you identify, In Nomine can be a particularly fun setting to explore many things in.

There are other gamers out there in this anonymous city who are looking for something with a priority on character, setting and story, but still plenty of crunch.

I'm a professional fiction writer, with a love of system mechanics, who's been out of the loop for several years due to health. Last year, I tried the local facebook groups and things like meetup.com, but it all amounts to just hoping I'll just find the right group out there. In truth, such things are rare. If you want something specific, you generally have to build it yourself.

So this is my add. I'm in my 30s, and I've been playing tabletop RPGs since I was about 3. I ran games professionally in college, and hung out with a variety of game designers in the late 90s talking about mechanics. Nothing against D&D (I still have a shelf full of old 3.0&3.5 books) i'm just not interested in systems that prioritize combat as a form of conflict resolution or have large Hit point pools.

2qn3w,ebso5i,I'm paying a homeless guy's rent for the next 2.5 months. I need help finding him a job.," Hey all.

TL;DR: I made friends with a homeless guy and got him an apartment. I told him I'd pay for his food and lodgings till February, but he needs to get a job past then. I'm looking for leads.

I made friends with a homeless guy I passed every day on the way to work. He was always reading so we talked about books, and the long & short of it is we became friends. Given his intelligence and relative equanimity, I didn't think it made any sense that he was on the street, so I asked him how he'd got stuck there. He told me his side of his story, which was pretty tragic, and which I believed. I asked him why he couldn't get a job, and the answer he gave me, basically, was that he spent all his energy surviving homelessness. There were a large number of practicalities which he just couldn't see to in his current condition, and which kept him from making and carrying out any long-term plans. For instance, he couldn't figure out how to get a bank account to get paid into. He had one set of dirty clothes -- getting and keeping more than that was very difficult, given how regularly he was stolen from. Getting an address was a big problem for all sorts of reasons. There are all these little things which get much harder when you've lived off the grid a few years, and much, much harder when you're seriously depressed to boot.

As winter started getting serious, it bugged me to high hell that he'd be out on the streets. I put myself in his shoes, and I realized that it wouldn't take too many winters outside in New York to ruin me beyond hope of recovery to a normal, healthy mental state. I didn't want that to happen to him. It felt like a stupid, stupid waste for this nice, intelligent guy to be spending all his energy dodging cops to sleep in construction sites and other homeless people trying to steal his shit, rather than working at some bodega or even desk job somewhere, reading books and drinking coffee in his off time and minding his own business. When I see a guy on the street covered in shit and piss, begging for nickels, I feel bad, but I know that there is nothing I can really do beyond ease his suffering for a night at most. With my friend, I felt differently: if he could just have a warm place to stay and a bit of support, there was a real chance he could become a regular person like anyone else. He could have an apartment, a job, a girlfriend, friends, maybe even a family some day. Or, without support, he could suffer in vain through life on the street, drawn downwards and downwards every day, and who knows how many winters he'd remain intact before the streets of the City finally broke him to pieces? At some point I decided I would pay his rent through the winter. I could afford it, and he needed it, and its what my conscience told me to do.

I can't convince anyone reading this to accept my trust of this guy or his story. All I'll say is, I've never been a sucker, and I'm not a sucker now, and I believe him. If you think I'm getting played, I understand, but please don't try to convince me of it. I'm not interested in wasting my energy on thinking about that. I consulted my skepticism already. I'm past that at this point. I don't think he's lying, and if he isn't, then what he needs right now is an ally, not a doubter. Getting him on his feet is a project. I've written down a figure specifying the amount I'm willing to put into this project, and I consider that money already gone. All that's important is that I do what I can to help this dude out with the resources I've allocated to the task. 

In mid-November we got him set up in a room in Chelsea which was affordable enough for me to feel okay about. Since then I've been trying to get him back on the grid and looking for work with some success. He's got a cell-phone now. We'll be trying to set up a bank account in the next few days, and thanks to his veteran status, we've got him set up with a pro-bono lawyer to help handle any liens which might be levied against him from unpaid medical bills accrued during his time in the street. I'm going to try to get him to go to the doctor and the dentist. I can help him with all of this because I've got Google and a phone and a bit of energy. But the most important single thing is that he get a job, and I am not sure how to help him with that.

The basic problem is that I don't know what the job market looks like from his perspective. I work a white-collar 9-5, and I've never worked any other kind of position else more or less. I just don't know where a guy in his situation should be looking for employment. I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas or advice or leads. Some positive qualities of his:

1. He's a voracious and careful reader
2. He's very personable and socially intelligent
3. His teeth are pretty fucked up, but he's not bad on the eyes
4. He seems remarkably trustworthy and decent (one of the reasons we became friends in the first place)
5. If it gives him any points in your book, he's a veteran

I can't speak to his work ethic because I don't know him in that capacity, but my impression is he's very eager to rejoin the working world.

Okay. That's my spiel. If you have any leads or have any advice for where this guy can get work, reply here or send me a DM.

Also, if you know a decent place for him to live, that finds his lack of references / recent past acceptable, DM me. He's looking for places that cost less than $1000 a month, and is willing to move wherever that's feasible.",,False,0.96,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/manhattan/comments/ebso5i/im_paying_a_homeless_guys_rent_for_the_next_25/
2qn3w,ebkree,Free Comedy in the West Village Tuesday Evening,"Hi! I run a comedy/variety show every Tuesday evening at Oppa Bar (162 West 4th, near 6th avenue) @ 7:30. Its free with no drink minimum. To recap last week:

SLAM!NA was an orgy of chaos last week. In order to honor my line-up of favorite weirdos, I bombed colossally. Absolutely not on purpose, every sentence I uttered was humorless. I didn't even realize I was doing it until in crystal clear silence I noticed the place had an air-conditioner, which was on low. This rudderless evening was riddled with faulty music cues, a naked Japanese man, and a birthday party which stumbled into one of the few acts involving a whip and rubber penis that brings you further from orgasm.

Believe it or not, what you just read is an endorsement! I'm adding new ingredients to the mix tomorrow night; feel free to stir yourself into the pot\~

Javon will present 16 original works of acrylic and spray paint on canvas. ARTIVISM831 focuses on Javon‚Äôs portraiture work that brings attention to the human condition, focusing on themes of vulnerability, inner-strength, empowerment and cultural awareness. The exhibition will take place on August 31, 2019 from 4:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. at the prestigious Gallery 8 in Harlem at 2602 Frederick Douglass Boulevard. 

Javon‚Äôs work takes inspiration from music, politics, romance, community and a world in despair to ask the question: how can art transcend the boundaries of the canvas to encourage people to think, feel and hope? 

A Connecticut native, raised to never give up on a dream, Javon now calls Harlem home. Beginning at a young age, and dabbling with landscapes and realism, his art has transformed into visual narratives that capture the diversity of humanity utilizing daring, provocative and thought-provoking imagery and language. Through his art, Javon has discovered arts ability to motivate emotional release and impact the world. He prides himself on being unique and eccentric.

2sql6,at758f,Bartleby The Scrivener (part iv),"    By Herman Melville  

            Established in my new quarters, for a day or two I kept the  
         door locked, and started at every footfall in the passages.  
         When I returned to my rooms after any little absence, I  
         would pause at the threshold for an instant, and attentively   
         listen, ere applying my key.  But these fears were needless.  
         Bartleby never came nigh me.  
            I thought all was going well, when a perturbed looking  
         stranger visited me, inquiring whether I was the person who  
         had recently occupied rooms at No. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Wall Street.   
            Full of forebodings, I replied that I was.  
            ""Then sir,"" said the stranger, who proved a lawyer, ""you  
         are responsible for the man you left there.  He refuses to do  
         any copying, he refuses to do anything; and he says he pre-   
         fers not to; and he refuses to quit the premises.""  
            ""I am very sorry, sir,"" said I, with assumed tranquility,  
         but an inward tremor, ""but, really, the man you allude to is  
         nothing to me‚Äî‚Äîhe is no relation or apprentice of mine, that   
         you should hold me responsible for him.""   
            ""In mercy's name, who is he?""  
            ""I certainly cannot inform you.  I know nothing about   
         him.  Formerly I employed him as a copyist; but he has done  
         nothing for me now for some time past.""   
            ""I shall settle him then,‚Äî‚Äîgood morning, sir.""   
            Several days passed, and I heard nothing more; and though   
         I often felt a charitable prompting to call at the place and   
         see poor Bartleby, yet a certain squeamishness of I know not   
         what withheld me.  
            All is over with him, by this time, thought I at last, when   
         through another week no further intelligence reached me.  
         But coming to my room the day after, I found several per-   
         sons waiting at my door in a high state of nervous excitement.  
            ""That's the man‚Äî‚Äîhere he comes,"" cried the foremost one,  
         whom I recognized as the lawyer who had previously called  
         upon me alone.    
            ""You must take him away, sir, at once,"" cried a portly   
         person among them, advancing upon me, and whom I knew to   
         be the landlord of No. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Wall Street.  ""These gentlemen,   
         my tenants, cannot stand it any longer; Mr. B‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî,"" pointing  
         to the lawyer, has turned him out of his room, and he now  
         persists in haunting the building generally, sitting upon the  
         banisters of the stairs by day, and sleeping in the entry by  
         night.  Everybody here is concerned; clients are leaving the   
         offices; some fears are entertained of a mob; something you   
         must do, and that without delay.""     
            Aghast at this torrent, I fell back before it, and would    
         fain have locked myself in my new quarters.  In vain I per-   
         sisted that Bartleby was nothing to me‚Äî‚Äîno more than to any   
         one else there.  In vain:‚Äî‚ÄîI was the last person known to   
         have anything to do with him, and they held me to the terri-  
         ble account.  Fearful then of being exposed in the papers (as  
         one person present obscurely threatened) I considered the  
         matter, and at length said, that if the lawyer would give me  
         a confidential interview with the scrivener, in his (the law-  
         yer's) own room, I would that afternoon strive my best to be rid   
         then of the nuisance they complained of.  
            Going up the stairs to my old haunt, there was Bartleby si-    
         lently sitting upon the banister at the landing.    
            ""What are you doing here, Bartleby?"" said I.   
            ""Sitting upon the banister,"" he mildly replied.  
            I motioned him into the lawyer's room, who then left us.  
            ""Bartleby,"" said I, ""are you aware that you are the cause of  
         great tribulation to me, by persisting in occupying the entry  
         after being dismissed from the office?""   
            No answer.    
            ""Now one of two things must take place.  Either you must   
         do something, or something must be done to you.  Now what   
         sort of business would you like to engage in?  Would you  
         like to re-engage in copying for some one?""   
            ""No; I would prefer not to make any change.""   
            ""Would you like a clerkship in a dry-goods store?""  
            ""There is too much confinement about that.  No, I would  
         not like a clerkship, but I am not particular.""   
            ""Too much confinement,"" I cried, ""why, you keep yourself  
         confined all the time!""    
            ""I would prefer not to take a clerkship,"" he rejoined, as if  
         to settle that little item at once.   
            ""How would a bartender's business suit you?  There is no  
         trying of the eyesight in that.""   
            ""I would not like it at all; though, as I said before, I am    
         not particular.""   
            His unwonted wordiness inspirited me.  I returned to the  
         charge.   
            ""Well then, would you like to travel through the country  
         collecting bills for the merchants?  That would improve you  
         health.""   
            ""No, I would prefer to be doing something else.""   
            ""How then would going as a companion to Europe to en-   
         tertain some young gentleman with your conversation,‚Äî‚Äîhow  
         would that suit you?""   
            ""Not at all.  It does not strike me that there is anything    
         definite about that.  I like to be stationary.  But I am not   
         particular.""   
            ""Stationary you shall be then,"" I cried, now losing all pa-   
         tience, and for the first time in all my exasperating connec-   
         tion with him fairly flying into a passion.  ""If you do not go   
         away from these premises before night, I shall feel bound‚Äî‚Äî   
         indeed I am bound‚Äî‚Äîto‚Äî‚Äîto‚Äî‚Äîto quit the premises myself!""  I    
         rather absurdly concluded, knowing not what possible  
         threat to try to frighten his immobility into compliance.  De-   
         spairing of all further efforts, I was precipitately leaving him,  
         when a final thought occurred to me‚Äî‚Äîone which had not  
         been wholly unindulged before.   
            Bartleby,"" said I, in the kindest tone I could assume    
         under such exciting circumstances, ""will you go home with   
         me now‚Äî‚Äînot to my office, but my dwelling‚Äî‚Äîand remain there   
         till we can conclude upon some convenient arrangement for  
         you at our leisure?  Come, let us start now, right away.""   
            ""No; at present I would prefer not to make any change    
         at all.""    
            I answered nothing; but effectually dodging every one by the    
         suddenness and rapidity of my flight, rushed from the build-  
         ing, ran up Wall Street toward Broadway, and then jumping  
         into the first omnibus, was soon removed from pursuit.  As   
         soon as tranquility returned I distinctly perceived that I had  
         now done all that I possibly could, both in respect to the de-  
         mands of the landlord and his tenants, and with regard to my  
         own desire and sense of duty, to benefit Bartleby, and shield   
         him from rude persecution.  I now strove to be entirely care-  
         free and quiescent; and my conscience justified me in the at-    
         tempt; though indeed it was not so successful as I could have    
         wished.  So fearful was I of being again hunted out by the  
         incensed landlord and his exasperated tenants, that, surren-  
         dering my business to Nippers, for a few days I drove about  
         the upper part of the town and through the suburbs, in my  
         rockaway; crossed over to Jersey City and Hoboken, and  
         paid fugitive visits to Manhattanville and Astoria.  In fact I   
         almost lived in my rockaway for the time.  
            When again I entered my office, lo, a note from the land-   
         lord lay upon the desk.  I opened it with trembling hands.  It   
         informed me that the writer had sent to the police, and had   
         Bartleby removed to the Tombs as a vagrant.  Moreover,  
         since I knew more about him than anyone else, he wished   
         me to appear at that place, and make a suitable statement of  
         the facts.  These tidings had a conflicting effect upon me.  At  
         first I was indignant; but at last almost approved.  The land-   
         lord's energetic, summary disposition had led him to adopt a  
         procedure which I do not think I would have decided upon   
         myself; and yet as a last resort, under such peculiar circum-  
         stances, it seemed the only plan.   
            As I afterwards learned, the poor scrivener, when told that   
         he must be conducted to the Tombs, offered not the slightest  
         obstacle, but in his own pale, unmoving way silently ac-   
         quiesced.  
            Some of the compassionate and curious bystanders joined   
         the party; and headed by one of the constables, arm-in-arm   
         with Bartleby the silent procession filed its way through all   
         the noise, and heat, and joy of the roaring thoroughfares at   
         noon.  The same day I received the note I went to the Tombs, or,  
         to speak more properly, the Halls of Justice.  Seeking the  
         right officer, I stated the purpose of my call, and was in-   
         formed that the individual I described was indeed within.  I    
         then assured the functionary that Bartleby was a perfectly  
         honest man, and a greatly to be compassioned (however  
         unaccountable) eccentric.  I narrated all I knew, and closed by  
         suggesting the idea of letting him remain in as indulgent  
         confinement as possible till something less harsh might be  
         done‚Äîthough indeed I hardly knew what.  At all events, if   
         nothing else could be decided upon, the alms-house must   
         receive him.  I then begged to have an interview.   
            Being under no disgraceful charge, and quite serene and  
         harmless in all his ways, they had permitted him freely to  
         wander about the prison, and especially in the inclosed grass-   
         platted yards thereof.  And so I found him there, standing all  
         alone in the quietest of the yards, his face toward a high  
         wall‚Äî‚Äîwhile all around, from the narrow slits of the jail win-  
         dows, I thought I saw peering out upon him the eyes of mur-   
         derers and thieves.  
            ""Bartleby!""   
            ""I know you,"" he said, without looking round,‚Äî‚Äî""and I  
         want nothing to say to you.""   
            ""It was not I that brought you here, Bartleby,"" said I  
         keenly pained at his implicit suspicion.  ""And to you, this  
         should not be so vile a place.  Nothing reproachful attaches   
         to you by being here.  And see, it is not so sad a place as one  
         might think.  Look, there is the sky and here is the grass.""   
            ""I know where I am,"" he replied, but would say nothing   
         more, and so I left him.   
            As I entered the corridor again a broad, meat-like man in   
         an apron accosted me, and jerking his thumb over his shoul-   
         der said‚Äî‚Äî""Is that your friend?""     
            ""Yes.""   
            ""Does he want to starve?  If he does, let him live on the   
         prison fare, that's all.""   
            ""Who are you?"" asked I, not knowing what to make of   
         such an unofficially speaking person in such a place.   
            ""I am the grub-man.  Such gentlemen as have friends here,  
         hire me to provide them with something good to eat.""   
            ""Is this so?"" said I, turning to the turnkey.   
            He said it was.  ""Well then,"" said I, slipping some silver into   
         the grub-man's hands (for so they called him), ""I want you to  
         give particular attention to my friend there; let him have the  
         best dinner you can get.  And you must be as polite to him as   
         possible.""   
            ""Introduce me, will you?"" said the grub-man, looking at   
         me with an expression which seemed to say he was all im-   
         patience for an opportunity to give a specimen of his breeding.  
            Thinking it would prove of benefit to the scrivener, I ac-   
         quiesced; and asking the grub-man his name, went up with   
         him to Bartleby.   
            ""Your sarvant, sir, your sarvant,"" said the grub-man, mak-   
         ing a low salutation behind his apron.  ""Hope you find it  
         pleasant here, sir;‚Äî‚Äîspacious grounds‚Äî‚Äîcool apartments, sir  
         ‚Äî‚Äîhope you'll stay with us some time‚Äî‚Äîtry to make it agree-   
         able.  May Mrs. Cutlets and I have the pleasure of your com-   
         pany to dinner, sir, in Mrs. Cutlets' private room?""   
            ""I prefer not to dine to-day,"" said Bartleby, turning away.  
         ""It would disagree with me, I am unused to dinners.""  So  
         saying, he slowly moved to the other side of the inclosure  
         and took up a position fronting the dead-wall.   
            ""How's this?"" said the grub-man, addressing me with a   
         stare of astonishment.  ""He's odd, ain't he?""   
            ""I think he's a little deranged,"" said I, sadly.   
            ""Deranged? deranged is it?  Well now, upon my word, I   
         thought that friend of yourn was a gentleman forger; they   
         are always pale and genteel-like, them forgers.  I can't help   
         pity 'em‚Äî‚Äîcan't help it, sir.  Did you know Monroe Ed-    
         wards?"" he added touchingly, and paused.  Then, laying his  
         hand pityingly on my shoulder, sighed, ""He died of the con-   
         sumption at Sing-Sing.  So you weren't acquainted with Mon-  
         roe?""   
            ""No, I was never socially acquainted with any forgers.   
         But I cannot stop longer.  Look to my friend yonder.  You   
         will not lose by it.  I will see you again.""    
            Some few days after this, I again obtained admission to   
         the Tombs, and went through the corridors in quest of  
         Bartleby; but without finding him.  
            ""I saw him coming from his cell not long ago,"" said a   
         turnkey, ""maybe he's gone to loiter in the yards.""   
            So I went in that direction.   
            ""Are you looking for the silent man?"" said another turn-  
         key passing me.  ""Yonder he lies‚Äî‚Äîsleeping in the yard  
         there.  'Ts not twenty minutes since I saw him lie down.""   
            The yard was entirely quiet.  It was not accessible to the   
         common prisoners.  The surrounding walls, of amazing thick-  
         ness, kept off all sounds behind them.  The Egyptian char-  
         acter of the masonry weighed upon me with its gloom.  But a  
         soft imprisoned turf grew under foot.  The heart of the eternal  
         pyramids, it seemed, wherein by some strange magic,   
         through the clefts grass-seed, dropped by birds, had sprung.   
            Strangely huddled at the base of the wall‚Äî‚Äîhis knees drawn  
         up, and lying on his side, his head touching the cold stones   
         ‚Äî‚ÄîI saw the wasted Bartleby.  But nothing stirred.  I paused;  
         his dim eyes were open; otherwise he seemed profoundly   
         sleeping.  Something prompted me to touch him.  I felt his  
         hand, when a tingling shiver ran up my arm and down my   
         spine to my feet.   
            The round face of the grub-man peered upon me now.   
         ""His dinner is ready.  Won't he dine to-day, either?  Or does   
         he live without dining?""    
            ""Lives without dining,"" said I, and closed my eyes.  
            ""Eh!‚Äî‚ÄîHe's asleep, ain't he?""   
            ""With kings and counsellors,"" murmured I.     

                             *         *         *  

            There would seem little need for proceeding further in this   
         history.  Imagination will readily supply the meagre recital of  
         poor Bartleby's interment.  But ere parting with the reader,  
         let me say, that if this little narrative has sufficiently in-  
         terested him, to awaken curiosity as to who Bartleby was,  
         and what manner of life he led prior to the present nar-   
         rator's making his acquaintance, I can only reply, that in   
         such curiosity I fully share‚Äî‚Äîbut am wholly unable to gratify  
         it.  Yet here I hardly know whether I should divulge one lit-   
         tle item of rumour, which came to my ear a few months after   
         the scrivener's decease.  Upon what basis it rested, I could   
         never ascertain; and hence, how true it is I cannot now tell.      
          But inasmuch as this vague report has not been without a   
         certain strange suggestive interest to me, however sad, it  
         may prove the same with some others; and so I will briefly   
         mention it.  The report was this: that Bartleby had been a  
         subordinate clerk in the Dead Letter Office at Washington,  
         from which he had been suddenly removed by a change in the   
         administration.  When I think over this rumour I cannot ade-   
         quately express the emotions which seize me.  Dead letters!   
         does it not sound like dead men?  Conceive a man by nature  
         and misfortune prone to a pallid hopelessness: and any busi-   
         ness seem more fitted to heighten it than that of continually   
         handling these dead letters, and assorting them for the   
         flames?  For by the cartload they are annually burned.   
         Sometimes from out the folded paper the pale clerk takes a  
         ring:‚Äî‚Äîthe finger it was meant for, perhaps, moulders in the  
         grave; a bank-note sent in swiftest charity:‚Äî‚Äîhe whom it  
         would relieve, nor eats nor hungers any more; pardon for  
         those who died despairing; hope for those who died unhop-  
         ing; good tidings for those who died stifled by unrelieved  
         calamities.  On errands of life, these letters speed to death.   
            Ah Bartleby!  Ah humanity!

PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) and PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) are both medications taken to decrease the risk of HIV infection. PrEP is a daily medication to help **prevent an HIV-negative person from getting HIV,** whether it be from unprotected sex, injection drug use, etc. PEP is taken immediately or within 72 hours **after recent exposure to HIV.**

2vxwk,chgu1i,"Death of Dawnson‚Äôs Creek star, Joshua Couch. A hit and run, or something more?","I‚Äôm on a group for unresolved murders/missing people. I lurk, but never post. Today I saw a post from a dad who was looking for answers or at the very least witnesses to his sons supposed ‚Äúhit-and-run‚Äù accident that occurred September 18,2006. His post pleaded:

>‚ÄùTo anyone who has lived in Greenwich Village for 13 years or longer. This is my son Joshua David Crouch. Josh lost his life on September 18, 2006. And as of today we still have no closure. This was a hit and run on the corner of Westside highway and West 12 street. Supposedly no one saw this happen? Really? This is in the heart of the meat packing district. And, also supposedly at 3:30 Monday morning. I stood on that corner for 24 hours a few weeks after this happened and it is a very busy area. Does anyone in the city recall this? Can someone come forward with information? As we here know, our pain never goes away and Josh being gone has left such a hole in our hearts. Josh has a brother Eric who is now 32, and Kristen who is now 28. Eric‚Äôs first child and our first grandchild (grandson) will arrive next week and as an honor to Eric‚Äôs brother he is naming him Easton Joshua Crouch. This accident can still be looked up online. I could go on and on about my visits to the city concerning people I spoke with and walked with for many years trying to find out something. Mysteriously, people I spoke to all of a sudden stopped corresponding with me. Police, first responders, ADA Eliot Felig, newspaper editor and even mayor Bloomberg‚Äôs assistant at the time. This didn‚Äôt happen in a secluded park or rest stop, and If anyone has ever been to this corner at the river and park one knows that this is a busy area of NYC at all times of the day. In closing, People talk and someone knows something. If, by any chance there is information of who did this, on my word you will remain anonymous. Please help.....‚Äù

For some reason this post hit me and I commented. This was Joshua‚Äôs father‚Äôs reply to me after I suggested maybe this was something more than a hit-and-run‚Äù

>‚ÄùThat's crazy [gresh88] that is exactly what we think. My wife never felt like this was the spot. Josh was supposedly three times the drunk limit and they (Bogus NYPD) say he walked from the bar ""Employees Only"" at 510 Huston Street to Westside hwy and West 12th street and then was hit crossing to go to the park at the river. He was maybe 140 pounds soaking wet and never, ever would have made it that far. That's it, that's how they left it. They basically pushed me aside. Very mysterious deeds by New York's finest.‚Äù


I did a little more digging online and found another post from what looks like his father 1 year after the ‚Äúaccident(?)‚Äù occurred on another website. This is what he wrote regarding what happened to Joshua:

>‚ÄùOn September 18,2006, my son Joshua aka LEFTist of Brooklyn, New York was killed in the early morning hours on the street in the West Village of New York. To this day, almost a year later there are no witnesses, clues or new information by the NYPD. This police force was/is neglegent in their investigation of my son's death. West 12 Street and West Street (or known by some as The Westside Highway) is a very well lit area near the Hudson River Park at all times of the day. This area is also well traveled at all hours of the day. Yet, according to the NYPD, there were no witnesses and Josh apparently lay in the middle lane for nearly an hour before being &quot;found&quot; by to police officers. When found, Josh was already cold (which takes at least an hour to occur). Josh is a founding member of the hip-hop crew Mindspray from the Bushwick section of Brooklyn and was/is well admired by those who know him. Is this a cover up by the NYPD because one of their own was driving drunk and mowed Josh down? Was Josh beaten and thrown from a fast moving vehicle? The M.E. said that Joshua's facial injuries were some of the worst he has seen. A police sergeant told me, then later recanted his story that &quot;I have been a police officer for a long time and the injuries to your son's face were not from a vehicle, but most likely from some type of instrument, maybe a bat&quot;! Two weeks later this sergeant said he never said anything like that. I have been asked, &quot;why was Josh on streets at 3:30 A.M.? in New York there are alway's people on the streets.‚Äù


To me there definitely seems to be more to this story than what has been offered to this poor family. I think this one hit me because of how likely it could happen to anyone and how a parent never stops loving their children and even more than 10 years later this father is still looking for answers. 

Do any of you know anything about this? Are familiar with this area? Could provide this man answers to his sons death? 

Thank you for taking the time out to read this.

2vxwk,1jb0w4,Ideas for (somewhat outside-the-box) wedding proposal in NYC (x-post from /r/manhattan),"THE MODS OF /R/WEDDINGPLANNING SUGGESTED I POST HERE:

Getting ready to pop the question to my girlfriend.

I lived in the **Bronx** and **Westchester County** the first half of my life. I now live elsewhere in New York State. I spent a large amount of my free time in Manhattan when I was younger. The two of us are likely going to be back in NYC for a couple days next month, so I had the inkling to ask her while we were there.

The question is how and where? I want to avoid cliche and touristy spots. Although I never lived there myself, I was in the **Lower East Side** as much as possible when I was a young indie-rock/raver bridge-and-tunnel kid. I gravitated towards the bohemian culture of NYC as much as possible. I made **Astor Place/St. Marks/Tompkins Square/Alphabet City** my constant hangouts. So if that gives any sense of the flavor I might want to stick to... Or what ideas/spots I would abhor or want to avoid.

My first two ideas I had are both a bust. Well the second one might be able to be modified.

First one was that I had a connection to get us into a taping of the **Daily Show**. Her and I both share the same sense of humor and we love comedy/satire/etc. My connection was going to try to set something up where I might be able to propose on-set prior to the taping (with J.S. being involved in some schticky way). But Jon Stewart ended up going on sabbatical, so I ended up thinking it didn't have the same sensibility with the fill-in host there.

Second idea centered around my girlfriend's predisposition towards things vintage/ancestral/genealogical, and also the fact that my family has this rich history in the NYC immigrant story. I wanted to plan a whole day of immigrant-related historical stuff: **Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Tenement Museum in** (what is left of) **Little Italy**. Then I wanted to conclude it by going to the spot where my great-grandmother lived after she came over from Italy.

I'm finding I wasn't the only one in my family with a connection to the LES. I always assumed my great-grandmother lived in Little Italy, but just discovered she really lived in what's now **Alphabet City**. Also my uncle lived just off **Tompkins Square** when he was a beatnik painter in the early 60's.

Part of these immigrant and LES-related themes I'm trying to brainstorm within stems from the fact that I am giving my girlfriend an **antique ring** owned by my great-grandmother that I recently had restored.

Here's the problem with my great-grandmother's former residence and proposing there: They have since turned the entire block she lived on into a giant **ConEd power substation** that is not publicly accessible (not that I would want to propose there if it was, obviously).

My girlfriend is *not* from the **NYC-Metro area** and has no real connections to it (other than her ancestors likely passed through Ellis Island, even if they didn't live in NYC). She definitely has no shared experiences regarding the LES. So if I did anything related to that, I'd have to find a way to fold her into the story somehow... Or present it in some context of me revealing my past and 'turning my whole person over to her', as cheesy as that sounds.

She also loves art and museums. The last time we were there, I took her to the **Guggenheim** for the first time and she was in her glory. Would want to balance any idea related to that with my 'non-touristy' requirement.



**tl;dr:** So basically I am fielding for ideas for proposing to my girlfriend in NYC that are either:

* Related to immigrant history, either in general, or on a personal, familial level
* Related to the LES and its culture, and my personal/familial connection to it
* Non-touristy/non-status quo; Perhaps a bit more genuine NYC cred, while still involving her
* Art/museum-related",,False,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenwichVillage/comments/1jb0w4/ideas_for_somewhat_outsidethebox_wedding_proposal/

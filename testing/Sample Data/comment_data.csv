Once they finished that, two sped back across Manhattan Ave and then stopped right next to each other in front of St Vitus to block one side of the road, with one still down by Dupont. This created sort of a half block barricade.

The area also had a bunch of Lyfts and Ubers driving around picking people up, with a small crowd outside the bar. They had to cautiously drive around the police  taking turns in the now narrowed road full of speeding cops.

- If you're having symptoms fill out this form and register for a test - https://covid19screening.health.ny.gov/
- You cant just walk up to a testing center

fxz5sj,fmxdbpn,"> Anil Subba, a Nepali Uber driver from Jackson Heights, Queens, died just hours after doctors at Elmhurst Hospital thought he might be strong enough to be removed from a ventilator.
> 
> In the nearby Corona neighborhood, Edison Forero, 44, a restaurant worker from Colombia, was still burning with fever when his housemate demanded he leave his rented room, he said.
> 
> Not far away in Jackson Heights, Raziah Begum, a widow and nanny from Bangladesh, worries she will be ill soon. Two of her three roommates already have the symptoms of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Everyone in the apartment is jobless, and they eat one meal a day.
> 
> ‚ÄúWe are so hungry, but I am more terrified that I will get sick,‚Äù said Ms. Begum, 53, who has diabetes and high blood pressure.
> 
> In a city ravaged by the coronavirus, few places have suffered as much as central Queens, where a seven-square-mile patch of densely packed immigrant enclaves recorded more than 7,000 cases in the first weeks of the outbreak.
> 
> In the month since the virus exploded in New York, it has claimed rich and poor, the notable and the anonymous. But as the death toll has mounted, the contagion has exposed the city‚Äôs stubborn inequities, tearing through working-class immigrant neighborhoods far more quickly than others.
> 
> A group of adjoining neighborhoods ‚Äî Corona, Elmhurst, East Elmhurst and Jackson Heights ‚Äî have emerged as the epicenter of New York‚Äôs raging outbreak.
> 
> As of Wednesday, those communities, with a combined population of about 600,000, had recorded more than 7,260 coronavirus cases, according to data collected by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Manhattan, with nearly three times more people, had about 10,860 cases.
> 
> Health officials have not released data on the race or ethnicity of the people who are sick, and officials from the Department of City Planning cautioned against drawing broad conclusions based on ZIP codes, which is how the city has released limited information about positive cases.
> 
> Yet health care workers and community leaders say it is indisputable that the pandemic has disproportionately affected the Hispanic day laborers, restaurant workers and cleaners who make up the largest share of the population in an area often celebrated as one of the most diverse places on earth. Latinos comprise 34 percent of the deaths in New York City, the largest share for any racial or ethnic group, according to data released by state officials on Wednesday.
> 
> The neighborhoods also have large communities of Indian, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Filipino and Nepali people, and a score of other ethnicities that have been devastated by the pandemic.
> 
> The city-run Elmhurst Hospital Center was one of the earliest and hardest-hit by the virus. Dozens of Covid-19 patients have clogged hallways as they wait for beds, terrified, alone and often unable to communicate in English.
> 
> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the epicenter of the epicenter,‚Äù said Councilman Daniel Dromm, who represents Elmhurst and Jackson Heights. He became emotional as he took stock of losses that included five friends and more than two dozen constituents. ‚ÄúThis has shaken the whole neighborhood,‚Äù he said.
> 
> In their daily toll of the fallen, city and state health officials have not disclosed where exactly deaths are occurring. But community leaders and organizers have kept their own tallies, providing a window into the virus‚Äô disproportionate impact on immigrant communities. Some of the more prominent names in Queens include the Rev. Antonio Checo, a pastor at St. Mark‚Äôs Episcopal Church in Jackson Heights; Lorena Borjas, a transgender activist; and Kamal Ahmed, the president of the Bangladesh Society.
> 
> The New York Taxi Workers Alliance said 28 drivers had died ‚Äî the vast majority of them immigrants living in Queens ‚Äî and Make the Road New York, an advocacy organization that serves the area‚Äôs working-class Latinos, said eight of its members in Queens had died. ‚ÄúA tragedy is unfolding,‚Äù said the co-director, Javier H. Vald√©s.
> 
> The crisis has transformed the neighborhood. Roosevelt Avenue, the vital commercial artery that normally bustles with taquerias, arepa stands, threading salons and shops selling newspapers in dozens of languages, has all but shut down. The eerie silence is intermittently broken by sirens and the clattering of trains on elevated tracks.
> 
> A handful of street vendors have returned, but now they sell masks and dress in Tyvek suits. With churches and mosques closed, families of the dead can mourn only at home.
>
> 
> The chockablock density that defines this part of Queens may have also have been its undoing. Doctors and community leaders say poverty, notoriously overcrowded homes and government inaction left residents especially vulnerable to the virus.
> 
> ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the city communicated the level of danger,‚Äù said Claudia Zamora, the interim deputy director of New Immigrant Community Empowerment, an advocacy group and worker center in Jackson Heights.
> 
> In early March, she said, city health officials sent out fliers with hand-washing tips, but not the outreach workers and multilingual posters that might have conveyed the looming peril.
> 
> The sick now include laborers like √Ångel, 39, a construction worker from Ecuador who asked that only his first name be used because of his immigration status.
> 
> Like many, he said he worked at a Manhattan construction site until he fell ill. He said he was turned away from Elmhurst Hospital because his symptoms were not deemed life-threatening and had been suffering in the apartment in Corona he shares with three other workers. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anyone to help me,‚Äù he said.
>
> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anyone to help me,&rdquo; said &Aacute;ngel, a 39-year-old construction worker from Ecuador.
> ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anyone to help me,‚Äù said √Ångel, a 39-year-old construction worker from Ecuador.
> 
> City officials rejected the suggestion that they left the city‚Äôs immigrant neighborhoods to fend for themselves. The Department of Health, officials said, created coronavirus fact sheets in 15 languages. Officials mounted multilingual public service campaigns in subways and on television, and have provided continuous updates to the ethnic media including on the need for social distancing.
> 
> Ronny Barzola, a 28-year-old Ecuadorean-American from nearby Kew Gardens who works for the food delivery service Caviar, is one of the lucky few to still have a job. He slathers his hands with sanitizer throughout the day but worries about his mother and sister, both of whom are sick at home but have been unable to get tested. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to isolate when everyone is sharing the same apartment,‚Äù he said.
> 
> Mr. Subba, a longtime driver for services including Uber and Via, had stopped driving last month after picking up a sick passenger, said a cousin, Munindra Nembang, who added that Mr. Subba, 49, had been diabetic. His wife and two of his children were also infected.

fx9cz9,fmtmtn9,"I definitely don't think this is a fool proof method and most likely it‚Äôs all a toss up, but I figured might as well post my experience here. 

BROWSER: Microsoft Edge (Mac Version). Installed it after some people on other threads suggested that Edge or Internet Explorer seemed to have better results. Got through half the application on the first try before it timed out, the second time it all worked out.

I was originally trying on Firefox with mixed results. As expected the website kept timing out at various stages. Sometimes it wouldn't even load the file a claim page, other times I got through to page 4 or 5 before it timed out. Chrome just never seemed to work, but don‚Äôt know if it was just bad timing.

TIME: I started my attempt around 4.30pm Friday (which at the time was close to the 5pm cutoff time, don't know if that is still the case). Prior to that I tried at all sorts of different times during the day but eventually it would time out at some stage in the process.

PROCESS: Whenever I tried to go directly to the NYS unemployment page via a direct link it would just time out. So I figured I‚Äôd try to get in through a different route.

- Google NYS ID Login and click on first link which should take you the NYS login page.
- If you already have an ID, login. It will be a little slow but should bring you to the home dashboard.
- Then click on the DOL icon
- If that page opens, you can scroll down and click on the ""Unemployment Services"" button.
- If the next page loads it should ask you for your Social

From there on out just follow the steps and keep trying. Keep in mind that, it may time out at any point. 

I think the chances of timing out are higher if you're inactive or dwelling on a section for too long. Don't rush through it though, you don't want to make a mistake that will make you ineligible.",2,/r/nyc/comments/fx9cz9/your_session_has_timed_out/fmtmtn9/

If I'm just sitting down and someone is sitting 6 feet away... great, any droplets that come out of their mouth are probably not coming close enough to me that I'm inhaling any meaningful amount of them.

If someone is walking and I walk at the same pace 6 feet behind them, I'm walking at 4-5 feet per second and so I literally walk into where they were breathing just over a second later. If you ever see someone have a particularly wet sneeze near a light source, you know that the droplets DO NOT fall out of harms way in 1 second. You can still see the droplets floating around 5+ seconds later. I'm thoroughly uncomfortable with that level risk, and so I am giving a much wider berth than 6 feet when forward movement is involved.

And if I'm running? Now I'm going at roughly 9 feet per second. If I'm trailing someone by 6 feet... I mean, even trailing anyone within even 20 feet seems insane to me, as I'm running into their breath from 2 seconds earlier. You can sort of figure that you won't need anywhere near the same amount of distance on someone standing to my right or left, but I just can't fathom some of the runners who are letting themselves get as close to other people as they are.

fxtz85,fmwsnu2,"This seems like a nice thing to do if you are a luxury building with many $4k monthly rentals with tenants who are more likely to be back at work in a few months. It gives them a little more (temporary) flexibility with their bills.

It might also catch a couple of folks who would otherwise not pay rent because they couldn't afford the whole thing, and who don't know that no evictions proceedings are being accepted by courts now.

I think it's wildly optimistic to think that most people who cannot afford full rent now will be able to afford a 1.5x rent payment by July 1st. 

I doubt it's a good idea for any tenant to take advantage of this unless they can just keep that extra rent money sitting in a bank earning interest. It creates a new layer of legal agreement between them and their landlord and may end up jeopardizing other protections that may become available to tenants in the mean time. People who can't afford their rent now should be prioritizing basic necessities, and the management companies and courts can catch up later.

What a dumb response that was in hindsight. Looks like the travel ban was the right move and this is proof of that.

Now the question of why we didn‚Äôt do this to Europe sooner. We probably should have. But the tourism exchange of people between Europe and the US is greater than that of China.

It‚Äôs likely that a lot of Americans themselves contracted it while vacationing in Europe then brought it back here (as opposed to European tourists traveling in the US. After all, that seems more unlikely than the above). This was a fast moving situation. Were we supposed to block off US citizens from getting a chance to return home? Maybe. But it‚Äôs a tough call. Plus, we likely didn‚Äôt know the extent of the asymptomatic carriers back then. 

As far as Europeans getting any racism for spreading this - why should they? This virus has its origins in China, not Europe. It was very likely the poor food safety standards of the wet markets in China that created this. Europe has laws that are actively enforced regarding this.

You should all be ashamed of your selves. I don‚Äôt even have to wish your company loses business, because I know it will. Only when your hand was forced by the New York Attorney General you decided to act. You want to give regular members elite access free for a year? How is that fair to members like me who have been paying full price for elite. If you want to do that, elite members should pay HALF price for a year.

Same thing with disinfectant, sanitizer, wipes, etc. If we don't have our own we have none. And these are things we can hardly find in stores anymore.

At the beginning of all this, we were all coming to work. Then one by one our coworkers began to get infected. At the time, the unofficial policy seemed to be if someone came up positive, them and anyone they were in contact with had to go out on leave for 14 days and self quarantine. This worked until it didn't. Until a dispatcher in the Bronx came up positive and was in contact with over 100 employees. Who ALL were sent home on administrative leave. It was supposed to be for 14 days but some people were called back to work because management said they didn't have enough contact. This was when the 2 train stopped going to Brooklyn and the 5 started going instead. Shortage of employees. Things are really bad underground. My emails from TWU look like an obituary. Two to three deaths per day. It's frightening. Today, another dispatcher tested positive on the 4 line. They told everyone they were supposed to tell.

Second, they added a message at the beginning of the automated call process that now says they're using a ""call back"" feature where the reps will call you back... but it offers no further details about when/how they will or what you'll need to do to to get them to consider you...

fxif4i,fmv7zz2,"Read one google review of the island written by an ex-riker's inmate ... it's actually really nice (the sentiment).

> was an inmate of Rikers Island for 6 months in 2019/2020 and was fortunately assigned to the Hart Island work detail. Sure, I buried bodies. Approximately 15 plus a week and around 40 babies a month. A lot of people including fellow inmates thought this was a ghoulish job. For me I felt a connection. These people, fellow New Yorkers have no one there but inmates and our officers. These are people who served you coffee, cleaned your offices and countless other everyday jobs. They are mothers, fathers, sons and daughters and there was no one there at their burial. Captain Thompson was the head corrections officer for that detail and he gave these New Yorkers dignity and respect when we buried them. He has a vast knowledge of the history of this island and goes beyond his capacity to ensure proper maintenance and preservation of this island.
    
 > I am glad and excited to have learned the parks department will be taking over this Island in the following year to come and expect them to restore it, make it accessible to the people. It‚Äôs a part of our history, these are our fellow New Yorkers that should never be forgotten or abandoned. 

> On a more happier note, the island itself is beautiful. I‚Äôve fed raccoons by hand, dropped cases of apples and pears out on the Fields and seen entire families of deer come out and eat. I cut acres and acres of grass, cut down dead trees and many other tasks to preserve this island. There was nothing better then getting off Rikers Island Daily to work this detail. Sure, there were hours of hard labor but I feel a sense of accomplishment and a filled duty of service by giving both dignity and respect of the people I buried. Hart Island is a gem, beautiful, serene and full of history and stories. Once it is open to the public I encourage everyone to head over, pay some respect to these fellow New Yorkers, there‚Äôs over 100 years of them buried there.

fxe1qv,fmts4ao,Man that is sad,37,/r/nyc/comments/fxe1qv/86yearold_is_killed_in_er_over_social_distancing/fmts4ao/
fxe1qv,fmtqra6,"One Saturday afternoon in late March, as the coronavirus pandemic flooded hospitals across New York City with desperately ill people, an 86-year-old lost her bearings and started wandering the emergency room at Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center in Brooklyn.

The woman, Janie Marshall, who had dementia, grabbed onto another patient‚Äôs IV pole to regain her balance and orient herself, the police said.

The patient, Cassandra Lundy, 32, had apparently become irate that Ms. Marshall had broken the six feet of personal space recommended to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, law enforcement officials said. Ms. Lundy shoved the older woman, knocking her to the floor. Ms. Marshall struck her head and died three hours later.

Ms. Marshall‚Äôs death underscored how hospital officials are struggling to keep order in health care facilities overrun by the pandemic, as crowding generates a new level of fear and anxiety.

Initially, hospital officials handed Ms. Lundy a summons for disorderly conduct. But a week later, after the medical examiner ruled Ms. Marshall‚Äôs death a homicide, the police charged Ms. Lundy with manslaughter and assault.

‚ÄúHow do you put your hands on a 86-year-old woman?‚Äù said Ms. Marshall‚Äôs grandniece, Antoinette Leonard Jean Charles, 41, a medical student in Tennessee. ‚ÄúI also understand the fear level of every person in New York has. There is a notion of every man for themselves. But attacking an elderly person? That went too far.‚Äù

Ms. Lundy‚Äôs public defender, George Cooke, could not be immediately reached for comment on the charges.

New York officials imposed social-distancing rules ‚Äî maintaining space between people to stop the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus virus ‚Äî in mid-March, shortly after the metropolis became the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States. The virus has claimed the lives of thousands of New Yorkers in a little more than a month.

In a statement, Woodhull hospital officials said they were cooperating with investigators.

‚ÄúWe are terribly saddened by this death,‚Äù the hospital said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe are committed to ensuring a safe, health-focused environment in these very demanding times so our heroic health care workers can continue to deliver the quality, compassionate care New Yorkers need more than ever.‚Äù

The events that led to Ms. Marshall‚Äôs death began on March 27, when she told her niece she had a piercing stomachache. The niece, Eleanor Leonard, 72, called an ambulance, which took Ms. Marshall to Woodhull, where she had been treated for similar symptoms earlier in the week.

In the crowded emergency room, Ms. Marshall was diagnosed with a blocked bowel, and doctors said they would admit her, Ms. Leonard said.

But the hospital, in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus, did not allow Ms. Leonard or other family members to stay with her in the emergency room. Ms. Leonard said she could do nothing but wait by the phone for updates.

The next day at about 2 p.m., Ms. Marshall, disoriented, began walking around the emergency room, the police said. She crossed paths with Ms. Lundy, and the women ‚Äî both from Brooklyn ‚Äî got into an argument before the younger woman pushed her to the ground.

Ms. Marshall hit her head on the floor, lost consciousness and died hours later, investigators said. Ms. Lundy told detectives she had shoved Ms. Marshall because she ‚Äúgot into the defendant‚Äôs space,‚Äù according to a criminal complaint. The attack was captured on surveillance video, the complaint said.

Unaware of Ms. Marshall‚Äôs injury, Ms. Leonard kept calling the hospital that day. She finally reached someone shortly after 5 p.m. who told her that Ms. Marshall was with a nurse receiving medical care.

‚ÄúI thought, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs great. She‚Äôs being tended to,‚Äô‚Äù Ms. Leonard recalled. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know she was dead already.‚Äù

Ms. Leonard went to sleep feeling hopeful. Her phone rang at 3:30 the next morning. A doctor told her that Ms. Marshall had gone into cardiac arrest. ‚ÄúAre you telling me she‚Äôs dead?‚Äù Ms. Leonard recalled saying. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

Ms. Leonard said she went to the hospital later that morning, but after several hours of waiting was sent home without an explanation.

‚ÄúWe thought it was weird, cardiac arrest?‚Äù Ms. Jean Charles, the grandniece, said. ‚ÄúShe had gone in for something completely different. She suffered from dementia, bowel blockage, not heart problems that we knew of.‚Äù

Then a cousin on Long Island called Ms. Leonard with troubling news. He had seen a news report online. ‚ÄúDid you know your aunt was murdered?‚Äù the cousin asked.

Ms. Leonard then searched her aunt‚Äôs name on Google and saw news accounts. ‚ÄúI was so stunned,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt just tore at my gut that something like this would happen.‚Äù

Ms. Leonard wonders why hospital officials did not inform her about the incident when it happened. ‚ÄúI understand we are in the middle of a pandemic,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut to say nothing?‚Äù

Ms. Lundy has previous arrests, including charges of drug possession in 2018 and 2019, according to court records. It remained unclear why she had visited the hospital that night.

Ms. Marshall was born in Abbeville, S.C., in 1934, the youngest of 12 children. Her parents died when she was young and she followed some of her siblings to New York City, settling in Williamsburg, family members said.

‚ÄúShe arrived with big dreams and wide eyes, ready to take on the world,‚Äù Ms. Jean Charles said.

She became a successful accountant at a time when few black women practiced the profession, eventually working for the Social Security Administration and earning a bachelor‚Äôs degree from Queens College. She never married or had children, but she was a role model to her numerous nieces and nephews, her relatives said.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to remember her as a victim,‚Äù Ms. Jean Charles said. ‚ÄúShe always told us, there is no shame in being the first African-American in any field. She was a leader.‚Äù

As it has become customary during the coronavirus pandemic, Ms. Marshall‚Äôs relatives and members of her church, Concord Baptist Church of Christ in Brooklyn, were planning to attend a virtual funeral service on Tuesday to abide by social-distancing rules, her family said.

Ms. Leonard said she planned to ride in a limousine by herself to Pinelawn Memorial Park on Long Island and bid her one last farewell from inside the vehicle.

‚ÄúWe want to obey social-distancing rules, and yet she died because of these social-distancing rules,‚Äù Ms. Jean-Charles said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ironic in a very sad way.‚Äù",69,/r/nyc/comments/fxe1qv/86yearold_is_killed_in_er_over_social_distancing/fmtqra6/

And yes, you have to jump through the hoops to get the assistance, but in this times if you need it you have to apply (and I hope you are able to get it).

https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hra/help/burial-assistance.page

In the link above you can find the application form in English, Spanish and other languages as well as the information below 

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
Burial Allowance Application Process Background
The Human Resources Administration (HRA) will provide financial assistance to individuals in need of assistance to meet funeral expenses.

What can be covered
HRA will pay up to $900 towards burial expenses, but total burial expenses must be no more than $1,700. The cost of cremation or grave and grave opening charges are excluded, however, the cost of burying the ashes, after cremation is not excludable in calculating the $1,700 total cost. If the total remaining funeral bill expenses are more than $1,700, HRA will not approve payment. Any asset (whether or not previously assigned to HRA), that was available to the deceased or any amount that a legally responsible relative (e.g., a spouse or parent of a minor child) may have had on the date of death is considered an available resource and any amount paid or to be paid by any other source, will be subtracted from the $900 payment if the claim is determined eligible for payment.

To apply
The individual who makes the funeral arrangements or his/her representative must file an application within sixty (60) days from the date of the decedent's death with the Office of Burial Services by mail, in-person at 33-28 Northern Blvd., 3rd Flr., Long Island City, NY 11101, by email at BurialServices@hra.nyc.gov, or by fax at 917-639-0476.

For additional information you can reach us at 718-473-8310.

Please include any supporting documentation with your application or bring it with you to the initial interview.

Required documentation
A Burial Allowance Application Form M-860W completed and signed by the applicant.
One original certified copy of the Death Certificate (it will be returned to the applicant.)
A copy of the Funeral Contract also known as the Statement of Goods and Services Selected. The contract must be signed by the Funeral Director and by the party who made the funeral arrangements. The required sequential invoice number must appear on the document.
A copy of the cemetery or crematory bill, itemizing all charges.
Original itemized funeral bills signed by the Funeral Director and notarized in the presence of a Notary Public or Commissioner of Deeds. The funeral bill must be stamped ""Paid-in-Full"" if the charges have been paid.
Original fully completed Funeral Director's Affidavit forms signed by the Funeral Director and notarized in the presence of a Notary Public or Commissioner of Deeds, if there is money still owed to the funeral establishment.
Information and documentation regarding the decedent's available assets/income as of the date of death, and those of the applicant (if the applicant is a legally responsible relative) is required on each case.

This meant that he couldn't be dressed in the clothes my brother took to the funeral home; they just placed them in the casket. This was because decomposition can be rapid.

He was cremated. The funeral was about four days after he died.

We buried his ashes years later, after keeping them in the house. 

I've always been completely fine with it, because I felt like that wasn't my dad anymore. As I said, it definitely bothered my brother initially, but he's ok with it now.

You WILL get ripped off. SHOP AROUND.

3. Once I picked a home, I called them and told them I wanted to move forward. They took some info on the phone, and that got the process started.

4. I went down to the place and signed some papers, and cut the guy a check.",9,/r/nyc/comments/fxerzp/looking_for_advice_dealing_with_covid_deathfuneral/fmtye66/
fxerzp,fmu8l1a,"I work for an agency that deals with the elderly and we have had more than 20 clients pass away this week. So unfortunately, I have a lot of experience with that. 

There is a three week backup on cremations as of today. 

All funerals in nyc are working above capacity and a lot of them cannot take any more bodies at the moment. 

We have been advised from the funeral homes we work with to let the city morgue pick up the bodies and then they will pick them up when they finally have space again. 

Families have to make quick decisions. You only have 3-4 days to bury. 

Unfortunately the city morgue is only holding bodies for six days. So you definitely are better off, as a family, figuring out what you want before the time actually comes. 

For a direct burial (no service) at a low cost cemetery, is running about $2800 at the moment.

You can be there when they are buried. But there will be a limit to how many people can actually attend the burial. You cannot see the body however they will take a picture of your loved one if you would like to see. (Depending on their condition of course)

It is NOT true that all covid patients have to be cremated. Far from it actually. Much tougher to get cremated these days than normal.",9,/r/nyc/comments/fxerzp/looking_for_advice_dealing_with_covid_deathfuneral/fmu8l1a/

> New Yorkers have called 311 with nearly 4,300 complaints of people not social-distancing ‚Äî but the NYPD has issued fewer than two dozen summonses and made just three arrests, city data shows.
> 
> The kid-glove response was revealed as Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio remain worlds apart on the realities of social-distancing in the Big Apple.
> 
> ‚ÄúFrankly, there has been a laxness on social-distancing, especially over this past weekend,‚Äù Cuomo said at his daily press briefing in Albany as he extended the shutdown of non-essential businesses through April 29 and doubled fines to $1,000.
> 
> Gotham‚Äôs 311 system received 4,270 calls about crowds and gatherings between March 28 and April 5, but the NYPD issued just 21 tickets ‚Äî at $500 each ‚Äî and made three arrests for social-distancing violations during that same period.
> 
> Overall, the department has dropped the hammer with a paltry 30 summonses and five busts from March 17 through April 6, the department said.

fxlj0x,fmvaric,"I think Dinemarket just provides a customer-facing interface for vendors, and the orders actually get routed to each individual vendor.  The ordering workflow and validation don't seem to be built for a pandemic - I would guess that it's up to the vendor to manually validate and confirm each order after it's received.

For what it's worth, my order was delivered on time yesterday, even though the order was still in ""New"" status.

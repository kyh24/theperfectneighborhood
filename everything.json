        "Battery Park City is a neighborhood in New York City, New York with a population of 13,258. Battery Park City is in New York County and is one of the best places to live in New York. Living in Battery Park City offers residents a dense urban feel and most residents rent their homes. In Battery Park City there are a lot of bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and parks. Many families and young professionals live in Battery Park City and residents tend to be liberal. The public schools in Battery Park City are above average.",
        "There is a private security force in Battery Park City, that is very visible, and increases the safety of the neighborhood versus other NYC neighborhoods.",
        "One of the best areas to do almost everything in New York City. Movie theaters, amazing park for kids, amazing to eat a meal, walk to clear your mind or take someone on a date, play basketball with some ballers, expensive shopping, play volleyball, have a picnic, ride bike, and more.",
        "Clean , real safe , plenty things to do , lots of families , the waterfront, the restaurant s , the shopping, lots of things to do , always see plenty of security , the grounds always taken care ,well manicured , has a movie theater , place to run , gyms , you can’t beat the view of all the ships that go by , and also seeing the Statue of Liberty , and the skyline of New Jersey and the beautiful Verrazano bridge , what’s not to love",
        "Battery Park City resident since birth.  Love it here.  Hope to return after college.  Becoming very expensive.",
        "The parks, the activities, the views , the schools, the convenience, and now the stores and restaurants are all reasons to love BPC.  Every neighborhood in NYC may have downsides - you give up something - parks for restaurants or schools for convenience - not in BPC.  Love it here!",
        "Very pleased with the family-friendly neighborhood",
        "When we moved to Battery Park City in the 1990s, the area was a ghost town on nights and weekends.  Today, it's one of the best places in NYC, if not the US, to raise kids.  The great schools, convenient parks, water views, little league - residents have convenient access to everything that once drove them to the suburbs, especially if they have kids. But this is not a suburb, it's NYC with all the great stuff the city offers.  If you work downtown, the commute is convenient.  If you work anywhere in the city, most subway lines are a quick walk.  The Brookfield area and World Trade Center center frequently open top restaurants and stores  - then there is also the Tribeca, Seaport, Stone Street and Batter Park - all within walking distance.  The new Governors Island Park is becoming a real draw.  Public schools are nothing short of incredible.  PS 276 and PS 89 run through 8th grade.  #1 US High School, Stuyvesant, is located in BPC.  There is also an excellent select High School, Millennium High School, located in the Financial District, which gives preference to below-canal street residents. The risk and fear is the explosive growth of this neighborhood causing unknown impact.  For now, and likely some time to come, it's an absolutely awesome place to live, and so exciting.",
        "There are many dry cleaners in the area, too many really, but they are all great. The restaurants are few in numbers but are all decent. There are not enough nice cafes or bookstores. You can get most of the things you need here, though.",
        "the only place i've seen dogs running without it being an actual dog park was over in battery park i would n't recommend it for a large dog though since many of the ones i saw off leash are smaller breeds not sure if your dog is aggressive or not but just something i feel obligated to throw out if you are able to go early in the morning or later in the evening i'd give that a try otherwise i'd probably force myself to pick up running so my dog could also exercise without being in a dog park",

        "the brainchild of robert moses new york city's resident megalomaniac this bridge very nearly became a part of the city's landscape mayor fiorello laguardia wanted to construct a tunnel connecting lower manhattan and brooklyn but moses pressured the state legislature to approve a bridge instead which they actually did moses had recently taken over the triborough bridge authority and was in a unique position of having a tremendous amount of power without being beholden to city residents construction of the bridge would have decimated battery park and required the demolition of castle clinton for an on-ramp many city politicians including laguardia were vocal opponents of the plan but moses kept arguing that a bridge would be far less expensive to build than a tunnel which was n't true in the least the plan was approved by the city planning commission and would have been built had it not been nixed by henry woodring the secretary of war woodring argued that the bridge would impede access to the brooklyn navy yard never mind that there were three bridges downriver already and blocked all federal funding to the project unless a tunnel was built instead construction commenced on the brooklyn-battery tunnel in 1940. out of spite moses decided to close the new york aquarium which had been housed at castle clinton ; it moved to coney island re-opening in 1957",

        "> we are going to ride along the brooklyn bridge do not do this that said the williamsburg and manhattan bridges have dedicated bike lanes if you're just biking across the east river use those biking across the brooklyn bridge is a kind of hell because there are too many tourists that do n't respect the bike lanes for interesting spots with the bicycles go up the hudson river bike path basically from battery park all the way up to say the george washington bridge where the little red lighthouse is it's generally a nice ride and a good view there's also an east river path but it's not `` complete'' in that you have to go into city streets in midtown if you do the east river path you can certainly go underneath the brooklyn and manhattan bridges near south street seaport and that's a nice view there's also a bike path on the brooklyn waterfront from around brooklyn bridge park to red hook or something i have n't biked there so i'm not that familiar with it you should also be relatively comfortable with urban biking at least if you're going to be on city streets generally assume everything and anything might get in your way and get you killed bike defensively and generally yield the city has published a bike map of designated paths note that bikes are allowed on the central park loop but not on general walking paths also you might get better answers over at /r/nycbike",

It has a secluded, quiet atmosphere but is only steps to the Financial District, which makes it a popular home for those working in the vicinity of Wall Street. Residents speak of the small-town vibe where \"all the parents know all the kids\". There are two synthetic-turf athletic fields used for baseball, softball, kickball, Frisbee, soccer, football, and lacrosse (mostly for children's use, although adults are welcome as well). A number of public parks provide grassy areas to soak up the sun on a warm day or just people watch.<br> The neighborhood has a number of cafes and restaurants, grocery stores and markets, and a shopping cinema with a food court and cinemas. The rich and powerful moor their boats at the neighborhood's North Cove Yacht Harbor, where you can also take sailing lessons.<br> Tribeca and the Financial District are just next door when you want to venture out of the area and a ferry service can whisk you across the river to New Jersey.<br> Battery Park City is bordered on the north by Tribeca, on the east by the Financial District, and on the south and west by the Hudson River.",

Residents embrace the neighborhood’s peaceful environment, and can often be found running, biking and strolling along its waterfront esplanade.  Although the neighborhood gets busy at lunchtime and happy hour, the streets are quiet at night.

        "Battery Park offers high-quality schools, safe streets and greenspace galore. Residents stay active here.  Much of the social life takes place on the water, where you can catch Manhattan Yacht Club sailboats zipping by during races.  The condo towers of Battery Park City are within walking distance of Wall Street, making it a convenient place for financiers to live. What the neighborhood lacks in history it makes up for in quality of life.  The newly expanded Brookfield Place shopping center is a hub for restaurants, retail, and occasional concerts. "

        "The farmer's market always has the same vendors, but it's New York - most people keep to themselves",
        "It's pretty cold in the winter and very hot in the summer, but with the right winter coat and air conditioning, you can handle anything.",
        "I'm a student, so I'm not entirely sure what the job market is like; I work on campus.",
        "Great right now. Spring. Winter is very cold. Fall is nice. Summer bit hot",
        "Employment in this area ranges from  just retail and fast food restaurants.",
        "New York is fairly temperate but the effects of climate change can be felt. Especially with hurricane Sandy many New Yorkers became aware of how vulnerable they were to flooding. We've experienced more violent storms in recent years. Overall the fall and spring are the most amenable to everyone. In the winter everyone's in a rush to make it from one warm building to another and in the summer with all the metal, glass and concrete the hear can become oppressive. But overall the weather in NYC is pretty great.",
        "There's a fair number of politically active people in the area and there's a fair number of disaffected individuals who don't care. Almost everyone has some cause though. Whether its local community or political or environmental. Almost everyone has an activist streak for their own cause.",
        "As cynical as New Yorkers may be cynical we on average do have pretty great public services.",
        "The transportation available in New York is the best. The only downside is that the number of people using it causes its own issues. Cars are a problem during rush hour, trains get crowded, buses get crowded, every thing is there its just a matter of timing your way around a big rush.",
        "The job market is fairly disparate in New York. There's a decent number of minimum wage jobs working in the service industry (cashier, waitress, etc.) and there's a fair number of internships for college students who are looking for experience in the field (although because its New York almost all of these are highly desirable and competitive) then there's jobs in your field of interest that are usually fairly difficult to find. But jobs are scarce everywhere so New York is hardly an exception. It's the cost of living that makes the minimum wage jobs hard.",
        "I can't say what goes on behind closed doors but for the most part there are few displays of obviously drug or alcohol abusing individuals in public. There's the occasional homeless person but its not very frequent or on every block. In terms of fitness there's always people biking in the bike lanes or running nearby.",
        "It's Chelsea. There's gay people. It's New York. There's every race, religion, and background. The only thing that New York is short on is conservatives and poor people. Conservatives because its New York. We're pretty freakin liberal. Poor people definitely live in New York but the high cost of living, especially in this neighborhood, often excludes those of a lower socio-economic class.",
        "The seasons are from one extreme to another. Hot hot summers and frigid cold winters with a short spring and fall. Snow/ice creates a lot of transportation issues.",
        "Large gay community, many jewish people live nearby. A lot of international people including students. They are all very nice people it seems and have had no issues with any of these people.",
        "It seems like everyone likes to keep to themselves for the most part. No one has ever been nasty to me so I think the community is generally a nice and inviting neighborhood.",
        "There are many gyms nearby and healthy food options. People definitely seem to care about their image in Chelsea Manhattan",
        "Taxi Drivers and commuters are always in a hurry. Pedestrians have to cross with extreme caution because drivers don't care if you are in the road, they wouldn't be afraid to hit you",
        "Most people in this area are highly involved in the fashion industry. Jobs in fashion are readily available. Its also common to see any type of design job open in the Chelsea area. Its a design oriented place to be in Manhattan",
        "Its not a very bad neighborhood, if you are looking for tranquility and a neighborhood where its safe to be outside more often this would be it.",
        "It's a large city, so there's bound to be some crime, but it hasn't impacted me negatively and my neighborhood is fairly safe, even at night.",
        "Police are violent in this country tho. So im not sure",
        "Chelsea has very limited crime and is generally a safe neighborhood. While the police aren't always visible they're around when called. In any situation however its more important to be aware, and be safe in when and where you're walking. A little but if street smarts goes a long way in staying safe.",
        "Very little crime in this area. Some streets you should avoid because they aren't well lit.",
        "I enjoy the all the art galleries and small shopping boutiques. Also, there’s many great eats around the neighborhood especially with the new Hudson Yards shopping center. Chelsea can be very lively or chill and quiet depending of the of the week. I love living in such a great neighborhood.",
        "Hudson Yards is awsome! You have the Highline where you yaou can escape in a scenerary of trees, shrubs, plants and hear birds sing in a bustling city of Manhattan. a great palce to take pictures, free classes and entertainment. The Vessel, Shed, Mall, Chelsea Market, Google... will leave you breathless. Also, you can talk a lovely stroll by the Hudson River where you several choices or boat rides, the Intrepid Musem, see New Jersey, or go row boating or kayaking. You are near 34th and 42nd Streets to shop, eat, Broadway shows, Movies... So much to do!!!",
        "This neighborhood I would say is pretty safe compared to others but its also very dirty, trashbags everywhere... but besides that its pretty and theres lots of things to do such as; chelsea piers, parks, children park, dog park, food (chinese, italian, japanese, and fast food chains)",
        "Visitor in the city and thought it was a nice area. would definitely visit again. great experience and people were nice. safe area. Cons are that the place is not very affordable and the real estate prices are inflated; however, this is typical of new york city.",
        "Chelsea is really nice for people who are foodies, or really into art. It has a lot of both. It is also very family friendly with Chelsea piers being so close and there are a few public parks in the neighborhood. The main problem is the rent and cost of living here is very high.",
        "Love how lively it is! There is Chelsea market, Chelsea piers sports center, a YMCA, many pizzerias, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, and access to many trains. One of the downsides though is that it is extremely overpriced to live here. One avocado can be $4 in most stores.",
        "Overall the neighborhood is a great, I’d say there’s still room for growth when it comes to food variety. Suprisingly, there aren’t many healthy super markets in Chelsea. Safety could be improved a bit, mostly around the high schools in Chelsea.",
        "I LOVE THE DIVERSITY AND MANY CULTURE. IS A LITTLE AREA AND VERY SAFE. EVERYTHING IS IN YOUR HANDS AND VERY EASY TO LIVE. I LOVE THE OPPORTUNITIES RIGHT THERE.",
        "Love it. It’s very industrial and tons of things to do they have great eateries and shopping centers the people are great it’s family friendly and animal friendly",
        "it's a very good neighborhood. Quiet and not too many crimes around it. it's safe! you can see the police protecting the area. one of the things that I like about Chelsea is that it is located between downtown and midtown. Wherever a person moves in Chelsea will be close to the 34th street and nearby the piers. if you live between 9th ave and 8th ave, you can walk to the piers which is two blocks away from those avenue.",
        "The community seems very nice as a temporary living environment. It has its faults, like most areas, where there places where people do unusual things, but there are rarely any incidents that occur in this area since it is very populated.",
        "A great neighbourhood - centrally located with incredible access to transportation, amazing food, and lots to do!",
        "I grew up in this neighborhood. It is a diverse and rich community. People from all over the world. You meet fantastic people who take care of each other and care for one another. You have great schools near, plus everything you can possible need is walking distance. Recommend this neighborhood to anyone moving there.",
        "I spent the past four years of my life going to high school in Chelsea. This area gained quite the respect from me. Not only does it have an extensive accepting vibe, it is filled with tons of activities and opportunities. Whether it be strolling the High Line on warm spring mornings or finding a great meal with friends, Chelsea exhibits a form of livelihood. It became a home for me as I walked past beautiful townhouses and identifying with art in museums like the Whitney. Chelsea also has amazing art galleries, each having their own sense of vivacity. This area is one of the most splendid I have spent my time in.",
        "Beautiful neighborhood. Great tree-lined streets. Plenty of dining and shopping options. One of the best neighborhoods in NYC.",
        "I have lived here for several years.  There are many studios for spin, yoga, pilates, and gyms.  The food is good. The neighborhood is safe.",
        "I have been a Chelsea resident ever since I was 9 years old. Chelsea has a small town mentality, but a big town atmosphere. Night life is nonexistent, but it is a pleasant place to stay.",
        "I love the highline,and all the new high rise buildings under new construction. The west side of Manhattan and the Hudson is really changing the skyline and the community.",
        "There is a lot going on in the area between tourists, and those heading to the office, however, it is an area of Manhattan that has something to offer. Chelsea is home to the world famous Madison Square Garden (MSG) and Pennsylvania Station (Penn Station). It is also home to the High Line Park- which is an abandoned railroad track that has been renovated into a park (great views). Chelsea is also known for its Fashion District, with streets of fabric and trim shops, to the world famous fashion university, Fashion Institute of Technology. The area also has many historical buildings- like the historical US Post Office on 8th Avenue. It is a more saturated area of Manhattan, and is rather safe.",
        "Chelsea is a great area to live. Lots of places to eat and streets are never crowded. Also, tree lined streets are definitely pretty all year round!",
        "Everyone lives in apartments, so there isn't much greenery, but there are a lot of awesome buildings around. Housing is very expensive, though, particularly in this area",
        "Very little square footage per person for a large amount of money. Very little storage space and rarely private parking areas",
        "There are a good amount of local businesses around my area, however, they have been at a decline for some years now. This is because of the rising taxes and property costs make opening and running a small, independent business a lot harder than it used to be.  The end result is numerous big business stores but a decreased amount of smaller stores",
        "There are so many amazing places around to eat and grocery shop at. Bars have fun events like trivia night, unlimited brunch opportunities, and delicious food for all budgets.",
        "Trader Joe's is the best grocery store I've ever shopped in - everything is cheap and delicious. There are tons of convenience stores on every block, great for buying toothpaste or a midnight snack. Tons of amazing restaurants - Thai at Republic, teriyaki at Glaze, salads at Chopp'd, brunch at Penny Farthing or Brazen Fox!",
        "pizzerias, chipotle, mcdonalds, wendy's, taco bell, chinese food, thai food, plenty to go around",
        "Thing is I generally buy from big companies like CVS, Rite Aids, Duane Read. I dont really see mom and pop shops",
        "New York and especially the Chelsea neighborhood has amazing nightlife, and restaurants. The only are where it can fall short is price point although it can be a matter of opinion how expensive something is and often the more affordable options are pretty low key local spots.",
        "New York actually has some of the best tap water in the country and so drinking from the tap is perfectly acceptable. We get our water from reservoirs upstate some of which are currently being threatened by fracking. Otherwise it's a fairly clean city with its own fair amount of litter and pollution as is to be expected of a city this size.",
        "It's New York. There's Madison square garden for the huge events. There's innumerable number of small venues for independent artists. There's comedy clubs, art museums and galleries, dance theaters, music shows, you name it its in New York.",
        "Chelsea has the absolute best variety of stores. There's a large number of small businesses that do everything from bagels (A true sign of a good neighborhood. Any New Yorker can tell you a neighborhood is only as good as the bagels you can get there) to coffee and restaurants are amazing. There's of course the requisite number of chains from McDonald's to Starbucks and probably a odd number of health supplement stores (vitamin shoppe, GMC, whole body). In terms of availability of places to go and things to do Chelsea is the absolute best.",
        "There is a very wide variety of food options in Manhattan. In my opinion it has the most options of any other city in the U.S.",
        "It's NYC so parks and nature are very limited. Of what NYC does have to offer, I think that it is sufficient. The parks could be better taken care of.",
        "Madison Square Garden is the largest attraction in this area. Conveniently located near by is Penn station. There are also events held at FIT such as fashion shows and outdoor flea markets.",
        "NYC has such a diverse selection of stores, mom and pop shops. big companies, and other businesses. I live in Chelsea and this area has so much to offer such as shopping, restaurants, transportation, educational facilities, parks and sporting events.",

        "i'm paying a homeless guy's rent for the next 2.5 months i need help finding him a job hey all tl ; dr : i made friends with a homeless guy and got him an apartment i told him i'd pay for his food and lodgings till february but he needs to get a job past then i'm looking for leads i made friends with a homeless guy i passed every day on the way to work he was always reading so we talked about books and the long & short of it is we became friends given his intelligence and relative equanimity i did n't think it made any sense that he was on the street so i asked him how he'd got stuck there he told me his side of his story which was pretty tragic and which i believed i asked him why he could n't get a job and the answer he gave me basically was that he spent all his energy surviving homelessness there were a large number of practicalities which he just could n't see to in his current condition and which kept him from making and carrying out any long-term plans for instance he could n't figure out how to get a bank account to get paid into he had one set of dirty clothes -- getting and keeping more than that was very difficult given how regularly he was stolen from getting an address was a big problem for all sorts of reasons there are all these little things which get much harder when you've lived off the grid a few years and much much harder when you're seriously depressed to boot as winter started getting serious it bugged me to high hell that he'd be out on the streets i put myself in his shoes and i realized that it would n't take too many winters outside in new york to ruin me beyond hope of recovery to a normal healthy mental state i did n't want that to happen to him it felt like a stupid stupid waste for this nice intelligent guy to be spending all his energy dodging cops to sleep in construction sites and other homeless people trying to steal his shit rather than working at some bodega or even desk job somewhere reading books and drinking coffee in his off time and minding his own business when i see a guy on the street covered in shit and piss begging for nickels i feel bad but i know that there is nothing i can really do beyond ease his suffering for a night at most with my friend i felt differently : if he could just have a warm place to stay and a bit of support there was a real chance he could become a regular person like anyone else he could have an apartment a job a girlfriend friends maybe even a family some day or without support he could suffer in vain through life on the street drawn downwards and downwards every day and who knows how many winters he'd remain intact before the streets of the city finally broke him to pieces at some point i decided i would pay his rent through the winter i could afford it and he needed it and its what my conscience told me to do i ca n't convince anyone reading this to accept my trust of this guy or his story all i'll say is i've never been a sucker and i'm not a sucker now and i believe him if you think i'm getting played i understand but please do n't try to convince me of it i'm not interested in wasting my energy on thinking about that i consulted my skepticism already i'm past that at this point i do n't think he's lying and if he is n't then what he needs right now is an ally not a doubter getting him on his feet is a project i've written down a figure specifying the amount i'm willing to put into this project and i consider that money already gone all that's important is that i do what i can to help this dude out with the resources i've allocated to the task in mid-november we got him set up in a room in chelsea which was affordable enough for me to feel okay about since then i've been trying to get him back on the grid and looking for work with some success he's got a cell-phone now we'll be trying to set up a bank account in the next few days and thanks to his veteran status we've got him set up with a pro-bono lawyer to help handle any liens which might be levied against him from unpaid medical bills accrued during his time in the street i'm going to try to get him to go to the doctor and the dentist i can help him with all of this because i've got google and a phone and a bit of energy but the most important single thing is that he get a job and i am not sure how to help him with that the basic problem is that i do n't know what the job market looks like from his perspective i work a white-collar 9-5 and i've never worked any other kind of position else more or less i just do n't know where a guy in his situation should be looking for employment i'm wondering if anyone has any ideas or advice or leads some positive qualities of his : 1. he's a voracious and careful reader 2. he's very personable and socially intelligent 3. his teeth are pretty fucked up but he's not bad on the eyes 4. he seems remarkably trustworthy and decent one of the reasons we became friends in the first place 5. if it gives him any points in your book he's a veteran i ca n't speak to his work ethic because i do n't know him in that capacity but my impression is he's very eager to rejoin the working world okay that's my spiel if you have any leads or have any advice for where this guy can get work reply here or send me a dm also if you know a decent place for him to live that finds his lack of references / recent past acceptable dm me he's looking for places that cost less than $ 1000 a month and is willing to move wherever that's feasible",

        "a few things *before* i start answering your questions : check out /r/nyc and /r/asknyc - both are far more active than this subreddit also check out both subs faq's for lots of great visiting nyc suggestions : 1. i would suggest youth hostels it looks like you can get a bed in a dorm for $ 55- $ 60/night the hosteling international and chelsea international hostel are the two best-known but there are many more hostels will be least expensive option plus they will generally be full of other students to meet and have fun with regarding your equipment i would n't assume that a hostel has safe storage - call ahead and ask if they ca n't provide safe storage is it possible that columbia can provide some secure storage for you 2. lodging in other boros than manhattan brooklyn queens maybe hoboken or jersey city could be less expensive although not that much less expensive you have to balance the location with what you want to do if you want to explore nyc nightlife you probably want to stay in manhattan if you are not a night owl and want to just see the sights during the day then the long subway ride out to the outer boros might make sense i'd lean towards staying in manhattan if you can though 3. are you asking about an mta metrocard if yes then a week pass usually makes sense it can be used on the subway and on busses if you are talking about a different pass please elaborate 4. not sure what express routes you are referring to - can you elaborate 5. take the path train it's easy cheap and relatively quick it is a separate system from the mta so you will probably need to buy separate tickets for this trip path info here : 6 amtrak trains are your best bet going between those two train stations the cheapest seats i see are $ 75 one way for a 3-hour trip in the middle of the night if you want to travel during the day the cheapest seats i see are around $ 100 one way flights nyc to baltimore are less expensive - they start at $ 135 round trip the flight is only an hour although once you get to/from the airport and leave in time for airport security the total travel time is about the same you can get to/from all the nyc airports and bwi airport baltimore via public transportation it looks like that is only on weekdays on the baltimore end though i like www.kayak.com for finding airfare i also want to add that most of the tourist attractions in nyc are very expensive and crowded and time-consuming you can have a much better experience doing what the locals do and eating where the locals eat i'm happy to provide further info if you have specific questions have a good trip",

        "advice are you moving this winter read this i know how difficult moving in the winter can be going out there when it's freezing cold to see apartments is no fun i work in real estate so i've used my experience plus the most recent advice posts on r/nycapartments to create this small q & a for people moving this winter : **first question most people ask -** where do i live which is the safest neighborhood where are the cheapest apartments - let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you ’ d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you ’ d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you ’ d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have",

        "In Chelsea, everything you need is at your fingertips, especially when it comes to transportation. It’s conveniently located near a number of subway lines, the PATH train, and Penn Station.",
        "Gallery openings, outdoor lounging, and a new place to discover around every corner.",
        "Chelsea is home to numerous galleries, with the epicenter of the art scene out on 10th and 11th avenues.",
        "A quiet, residential area that caters to a more tranquil lifestyle.",
        "In Chelsea, traffic can be loud, and streets are usually crowded with pedestrians during the day.",
        "Newer high-rise buildings, sprawling warehouses, and some steals in post-war walk-ups.",
        "In Chelsea, price points are high for luxury buildings, and slightly more affordable for smaller walk-ups.",
        "The class and culture, minus the pretension.",
        "Chelsea is a diverse neighborhood with a rich history of social activism and artistic expression. It welcomes neighbors of all kinds to add to its charm.",
        "Upscale and artsy, this neighborhood has everything you need for a great lifestyle.",
        "Once an immigrant neighborhood full of warehouses, Chelsea has evolved into one of the most desirable and expensive parts of New York City. This is a vibrant area full of dining, shopping, and nightlife, art galleries, and studios. The bulk of the celebrated High Line Park winds through Chelsea all the way up to 34th Street, where the park ends. And you've got the Chelsea Piers nearby. This is a large sports and entertainment complex that sits on the Hudson River. It includes synthetic fields for every type of sport you can imagine, a driving range for golf, batting cages, an ice rink, a skate park, bowling lanes, and restaurants.<br> Along its main avenues and along the High Line Park shiny new condo towers dominate. The stature of buildings tends to decrease as you move away from these areas, however, and you'll soon find old brick tenement housing converted to walk-up apartments. Many of its side streets are quaint, tree-lined, and quiet but the north end of Chelsea feels more industrial, lacks the greenery, and mostly has large apartment and condo complexes.<br> Given the size of this neighborhood, some residents (and real estate agents) might refer to distinct parts, such as West or East Chelsea to describe the areas separated by the High Line. You'll find a mix of people here, although the middle class is largely being squeezed out by the increase in cost of living. Chelsea is a popular home for Manhattan's LGBTQ community.<br> Chelsea is bordered on the north by Hell's Kitchen and the Garment District, on the east by the Flatiron District, on the south by Meatpacking and the West Village, and on the west by the Hudson River.",
        "Chelsea is one of the most action-packed neighborhoods in New York City.  Vibrant and fast-paced, there is always a new restaurant, bar, or dance club to wander into at any time of day or night.  Residents thrive on the 24/7 atmosphere. ",
        "If you’re looking for a staid, quiet place to live, Chelsea is not for you.  Its thriving arts scene has always been a big draw for creative types.  Not surprisingly, residents pay a high price to live in such a hip and happening part of Manhattan.  The neighborhood has some of the most exclusive restaurants and bars in the city, and real estate prices are steep — especially for new condos along the High Line.  Slip down many of the side streets, however, and you're likely to find some beautiful and historic townhouses nestled gracefully within the neighborhood's hustle and bustle. ",

        "The Chelsea Hotel has been home to many artists, writers, and musicians, including Patti Smith, Dylan Thomas, Andy Warhol and Allen Ginsberg. ",
        "Chelsea is a cultural hub of New York City, housing some of the best art galleries and performance venues in the world. ",
        "Chelsea is a geographically wide neighborhood, so depending on where you live, it can be a hike to the subways. ",
        "In recent years, Chelsea has seen tons of new development, with shiny, ultra-luxury condos cropping up, especially along the High Line.  But much of the neighborhood's traditional housing stock consists of prewar co-ops, which are usually listed at much lower prices. ",
        "Chelsea has long been a haven for artists, although the scene these days is decidedly more upscale than it was in the 1970s and '80s. Some of the city's best restaurants are here, and are open day and night.  When they called NYC the city that never sleeps, they were probably thinking of Chelsea. There are quiet, peaceful scenes to be found amid the urban sizzle.  Beautiful townhouses line Chelsea's side streets, and the High Line provides a bit of fresh air and sunlight above the traffic. Although there is green space to be found in Chelsea, one is rarely alone in it.  This is one of the densest residential neighborhoods in the city. Chelsea remains a cultural hub of the city.  Take in world-renowned dance at the Joyce Theater, stroll through famous art galleries, or pay a visit to the Whitney Museum in its new downtown location. "

There are also food shops and asian groceries stores everywhere who have existed for decades. There is always a bubble tea store around the corner. Slowly, there are a lot of newer, more modern type dessert shops and restaurants that are replacing the older local ones. Due to more gentrification, a lot of the original culture and stories have been lost. This is one thing I wish could change. There should be more support for the local businesses.",
        "The thing I like about Chinatown is the restaurants. Eating there might as well be a luxury as there is a variety of Chinese food that will never disappoint. The thing I would like to see change in is the crowded sidewalks.",
        "I used to like it until I realized how dirty and smelly it is. People here are very inconsiderate of their peers and neighbors and unfortunately the D and B train don't work very good on the weekends.",
        "After living in Chinatown in the past eighteen years of my life, I am glad to call it home.

I love Chinatown.",

The streets are quite dirty as it is quite polluted.  However, activities such as the Lunar New Year Parade often unite the community together.",

What looks homogenous to an outsider is actually a diverse community.<br> This is a vibrant, densely packed area full of old tenement housing that’s been converted to apartments, cheap Chinese restaurants, Buddhist temples, historic sites, and stores selling knick-knacks (and, oftentimes, knock-offs) that spill out onto the sidewalk. Canal Street, which was once a canal, is the busy main thoroughfare and normally jammed with traffic. While there are lots of Chinese eateries around there isn't much of a nightlife here. But hip neighborhoods like Lower East Side and Tribeca are a short walk away.<br> Chinatown is one of the more affordable neighborhoods by Manhattan standards, but it's by no means a cheap place to live.<br> Chinatown is bordered on the north by Little Italy and Bowery, on the east by Two Bridges, on the south by Civic Center, and on the west by Tribeca."

City Hall Park, now a popular spot for workers to eat lunch outdoors, once hosted important speeches and rallies during the American Revolution and protests during the Great Depression. The African Burial Ground National Monument marks what is believed to be the earliest cemetery for blacks, most of whom were slaves at the time. Scholars estimate up to 15,000 African Americans are buried here. Additionally, many of the newspaper companies that helped shape the city were originally based here.<br> Civic Center is bordered on the north by Chinatown and Two Bridges, on the east by the East River, on the south by the Financial District, and on the west by Tribeca."

Maybe offering free dance classes or economic classes for college students struggling with student loans would be great.",

With the humidity and the heat creating a vortex of sweat, smeared make up, and possible ruined dresses while waiting for the subway, it makes you want to stay inside with the air conditioner blowing on the highest setting. However, once fall sets in the colors around Central Park and the rest of the area are made to make all of your instagram followers jealous. The sweltering heat calms down and settles into a nice breeze that is perfect for walks around the city.

There's a lot of crime in the area most of the time it's over some arguments that have been taken too far from a couple of just a drunk person bothering the wrong crowd. If you aren't from here or don't fit in it's best not to talk to anyone in the area since the wrong crowd always gets arrested here. Drugs are a main concern to the police here but they never make an effort to even try to stop it let alone suppress it.",

        "It's one of the cheapest neighborhoods in Manhattan, but you get what you pay for. It is convenient to live here. Grocery stores, restaurants, food chains, laundromats, and everything else can be found on most blocks. \nOn the other hand, safety for women is not great. I personally try to stay in after it has gotten dark. Busy streets, however, can often make it feel safer. \nIt is dirty, and many buildings have mice, rats, or other rodent problems.",
        "My experience in East Harlem has been very mixed; especially growing and seeing things that I never noticed when I was younger. The things that I finally noticed was the cultural importance of the latino community, with the influence and impact of the community being shown in multiple places throughout the neighborhood.",
        "The area is “up and coming” but at a slow pace. Downside is too many drug users and beggars outside of apartment buildings harassing people. Trash and human waste takes over 125th street. Police is present but do not enforce sanitation laws. Not a lot of residents take pride in the area.",
        "Quiet neighborhood and a great change of pace in Manhattan! Neighborhoods can be sketchy however pretty average. Harlem is currently going through gentrification so prices on real estate are increasing (naturally since it's Manhattan), and more stores are being opened.",
        "My family came from Italy in the late 1800s and settled in East Harlem. Best times of my life growing up here back in the days of Italian Harlem. I still come down to my catholic parish of Our Lady of Mt Carmel Church and the Giglio Feast in August on Pleasant Avenue. I also like the diversity of the area today because my grandparents came here for a better life. The neighborhood has shaped me into the person I am today. Very safe when I’m here to hang out.",
        "East Harlem is a lower class neighborhood in manhattan, most people are living in poverty and welfare. The crime rates are higher since 40 years ago due to homicide. In education, there are more students drop out of high school than other neighborhoods in manhattan because of gang activity, pregnancy, and family issues such as substance abuse. However, the neighborhood is gentrificated in a good way by enrolling charter schools for students to succeed for college so that the dropout rates will reduce and better playgrounds for children to be safe, but there’s a downside with gentrification according to the locals who lived in East Harlem for 30 plus years, small business owners began to move out, residents cannot afford their rent due to new landlords, and new apartments in empty space that can affect them. Although, East Harlem should be a safe neighborhood and for visitors to come or to live and to have a better future for the locals.",
        "I was born and raised in East Harlem so I am very accustomed to it. Over the past few years it has developed exponentially. With more and more diverse food spots, shops, and housing. Many of the parks have been revamped as well. There are still some sore spots but with time it will get better.",
        "Also known as Spanish Harlem, it is a very hispanic-based area with tons of delicious food options. The culture is amazing in this area and many affordable stores!",
        "I lived here for 5 years and love my corner of the neighborhood. The food is incredible, especially the bakery on 116 and second. The crosstown bus is slow, but there's generally not a lot of traffic. Its safe at night if you're walking with a buddy.",
        "Everything is really close, from grocery stores to subway stations. The bad thing is that it is really dirt and people are not very committed to keep the neighborhood clean.",
        "So far, it has been an excellent neighborhood. Good connectivity with the rest of Manhattan, good stores like Costco and Aldi, public transportation has a good commute time.",
        "I've been living in East Harlem for little over a year. I really admire the hard working people in the neighborhood. No matter the time of day or night you will always find a little Mexican food stand open for business. There are shops and restaurants around for people to enjoy at low cost. If there is one thing I would change is the cost of living. It's getting more and more expensive and there's a lot of low income families that have been living in the neighborhood for years who may not be able to live here no more.",
        "East Harlem has changed drastically in the last 30 years.  Once mainly a heavy populated Puerto Rican community, it's now more diversified.  Many people from other Latin American countries have moved in, as well as those from Europe.  While I don't have issues with this, I am witnessing more mistrust among the new immigrants here.  Also. many youths today are not participating in outside sports and there is still drug activity and crime in a more intellectual level.",
        "East Harlem is the true definition of  a New York City neighborhood. All ethnicities, religions, and walks of life, co-exisiting happily, taking care of & supporting each-other. I can’t imagine living anywhere else.",
        "Many housing projects, and crime that comes with it... dealing, shootings, etc. Biggest draw is East River shopping mall which is really big box stores",
        "Undergoing gentrification. The neighborhood has lots of new restaurants, greenery, and overall feels safer.",
        "I like the fact that East Harlem has a lot of restaurants, cafes, banks, pharmacies,   schools, and community areas. It's conveniently close to the subway station an has a bus stop, at least, every two blocks. \nI will like to see the Eat Harlem cleaner.",
        "East Harlem is an up and coming place in Manhattan. At the moment it is a quiet neighborhood that could use some improvements. It is community driven but could use some new business (food, nightlife, etc.).",
        "I love my house because it is new building and everything good.",
        "I live in an apartment so there are no driveways, just parking lots. The buildings are built quite closely together and most of them are comprised of the same burnt brick pattern.",
        "Its in Harlem so you are going to see poop on the streets and drugs but their is no houses just apartments you barely see anything abandoned",
        "The projects run this area. No one cleans here, violence is a very big factor here and the people think that NYC is their personal garbage. Abandoned buildings here don't even get rebuilt, they just sit there with no one making an effort here. Everyone relies on food stamps and welfare for their rent and such and won't put effort into looking for a job, it makes me sick when I see people not taking advantage of the opportunity they have infront of them!",
        "It's New York City, not everything will be fit to everyone's suburban dream, but it is a great area and city.",
        "where i live now its great a lot better then where i used to live. Not the greats but its good enough i would recommend to others",
        "Even though I live in a small apartment, it is very well kept and maintained.",
        "Roaches and mice! Utilities are fine. Apartments fill quickly.",
        "this is an urban area there's no houses, just building",
        "The rent can be pretty expensive. Housing is usually in poor neighborhoods.",
        "For the people that have been living here already, the inside of the house looks old and worn out. We have nothing new, for the new people, the inside of their home is beautiful because they have the new furniture. There is a roach problem and the workers refuse to help.",
        "Housing in East Harlem is generally NYC Housing Authority maintained poorly with mass amounts of vandalism (graffiti) and unsanitary sidewalks.",
        "There's no outdoor activities unless you count going to Central Park or jogging/biking around the neighborhood.",
        "It's NYC so there's ALWAYS something to eat regardless of the time! Tons of delivery places offer take-out during late hours, you just have to search for them!",
        "There's tons of corner stores that are usually open 24/7",
        "East Harlem, also known as Spanish Harlem, is home to numerous hair and nail salons. The amalgamation of different cultures and backgrounds can been seen here as well. Although they may not be considered fine dining, there are endless Spanish restaurants serving tacos and other ethic cuisines.",
        "Its the city there no nature just go to central park",
        "Their is alot of restaurants with different ethnic food that are really good",
        "There are only two bars here that would give you the experience of a good night out, most of them are small results of gentrification in my area, other wise most of the time if there were to be a place were most people could go for a \"good night\" at the end of the day it would turn into a post for the NYPD to hang out in order to get criminals.",
        "The stores in my area are usually Spanish since I live in Spanish Harlem, most of the people here always like to eat/drink so there are tons of Spanish bars and restaurants. There is also some cigar stores around here too since most people in this area love to smoke. The only popular stores around here are the fast food restaurants, electronic stores and the giant mall on 117st and Pleasant ave that attracts the most people anyway.",
        "It depends on if you walk a little bit uptown or a little bit downtown.  A few blocks downtown, you begin to see all the bars, diners, and diverse restaurants that are a bit more pricey. A few blocks uptown and you begin to see Hispanic restaurants and the occasional street vendor that are more affordable.",
        "They're not the best, but the perk is that they generally tend to be cheaper. The Hispanic restaurants serve pretty good food at reasonable prices.  There are average grocery stores, but they're more affordable.",
        "Seamless makes this area the best! It allows you to order from restaurants that are within a 10 mile radius, with their menu on display. Also, there is a great dive bar called Bar Coastal that has the best wings and popcorn shrimp, along with excellent staff.",
        "Ricky's has become one of my favorite retailers!",
        "There is stores everywhere you go nothing bad about that.",
        "there's a lot of different places to get food around here but yet again they pretty much are all the same",
        "Its NYC  not much of an outdoor life, we'er called the concert jungle  for a different reason",
        "there's basic businesses most of them are the same a different type of store would be great",
        "The restaurants around the area are all top quality, perfect for any type of meal.",
        "All the stores and businesses are generally nice in this area. Well maintained and presentable.",
        "There is a lot of fast food stores around me",
        "I visit different Laundromats, stores, retails shops, etc.  Majority of them are easy to get to and are clean.  If one store doesn't have what i need, then, another store in the area usually does.  I don't have to go far to go shopping which makes life easier for me.",

So while brand new developments and renovated walk-ups offer housing to new, affluent residents, there are still sections of poorer tenement housing. East Harlem also has one of the highest concentrations of public housing in the city. Crime has fallen in many parts of this neigbhorhood but you should still exercise caution, particularly at night.<br> But overall East Harlem has a lot of pride and a strong sense of community. It was once a popular area for Italian immigrants until the 1930s, then became predominantly Puerto Rican for decades, and recent years have brought an influx of Mexicans, Dominicans, and New Yorkers fleeing more expensive parts of the city. Murals throughout the neighborhood illustrate its fluid history.<br> The neighborhood is a foodie paradise, with street stalls offering Mexican food next to impossible-to-get-into Italian restaurants. A number of highly rated burger joints dot the area.<br> The East River Plaza is a large shopping center with several big box retailers, including Costco, Target, and PetSmart.<br> East Harlem is bordered on the north by north and the east by the Harlem River, on the south by the Upper East Side, and on the west by Central Park and Harlem.",

No stranger is going to stop and talk to you because everyone is busy and on the way to something. It's also not much of a place where people settle down or have kids; it's a lot of independent people who are ambitious with their work and interests. There are lots of events to go to, but they're more touristy and not relevant to the \"community.\"",

There are many downsides to the East Village: for example, the presence of popular destinations such as Union Square and St. Mark's means that the area is often populated. This is not the neighborhood for someone who wishes to get off the subway and walk down quiet streets to his or her home. However, the atmosphere is always vibrant and artistic. There are many wonderful hidden gems in this neighborhood, especially a little further east (1st Ave and on) that doesn't garner as much tourism. The neighborhood has a wonderful sense of diversity. In terms of transportation, living in close proximity to Union Square offered convenient access to the green and yellow lines, as well as the L train. Additionally, there are multiple bus lines that stop in the area.",

        "Nothing to write home about, good or bad.",
        "I would describe the ability to find housing in this area as very easy. The question then becomes how much are you interested in paying for rent? The cost of living can prove quite costly if you are buying and not renting. In my opinion I would consider the cost of renting to be above market rate unless you live in Public Housing. Most of the apartments for rent do not include utilities or electricity. The best thing about living in New York is that the water is free if you are a renter. \r\n\r\nThe worst areas to live in is areas that are close to the East River or Hudson Rivers because flooding has been a problem in the past.",
        "I live in the projects and the maintenance of one's home is depended on how well they take care of their apartments.  During the night it is not very safe at all. Crime is constantly heard of but nothing so much during the day.",
        "I live on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City. The vast majority of housing available in this area is converted tenement housing. Though many of these apartments have been renovated to code and could even be considered nice apartments, there are limitations to this sort of setup. For me this is not so much of a problem because my primary concern is affordable and decent housing, not luxury.",

        "It is always poppin thursday to sunday",
        "When it comes to basic needs like food, you can get anything you want for a descent price. There are a bunch of bodegas and some are open 24hrs. There is a drug store, pharmacy, and plenty of bars for night life. There aren't a lot of chains, the only one, which is new, is a 7/11/. I never go there, and alot of the community avoids it as well because it closed a mom and pop shop. There are also local gardens who compost which is cool. There are a bunch of vintage and thrift stores, some are better than others. I just hope not too many people try to move here because then stuff will get even more expensive. Also, shout out to Rays Candy Store, Sunny and Annies Deli, and No Relation!",
        "Any and every human being could be satisfied with at least one of the hundreds of restaurants within a five-ten minute walk from the apartment. Name a country and you will likely find their native cuisine a few blocks away. Want to go to an upscale bar, not a problem. How about a sports bar or laid back bar with friends? Find copious amounts of them everywhere. There are fewer clubs in this neighborhood than others, but hop on the subway and you can be there in no time.",
        "In the heart of the East Village, small family owned businesses dominate. From the cupcake store next to the ice cream store, the new Italian restaurant around the corner from the Thai restaurant, and the homemade bagels down the block, food is at a premium. There is an amazing family owned drug store a five minute walk away with all your daily sick needs and a pharmacist to help.

        "34 m4f # nj # nyc - looking for close friend hangout partner and more this is going to be a little long so thanks in advance if you're willing to read on i'm looking for a female friend to enjoy the city and its activities to potentially foster a deeper and more intimate relationship i'm not looking for anything super serious at the moment for now i just want a close friendship or casual relationship at most a companion to have fun with and make an emotional & physical connection **i should mention this upfront to avoid wasting time if you're going to stop responding after a few days or a week then there's no point to dm me if you're unwilling or unlikely to actually meet up in person then also do n't bother the point of this post is to find someone to actually hang out with in real life one last thing do n't message me if the first question you will ask is `` do you have a pic'' i'm totally cool with exchanging pics after we've established a dialogue and have gotten to know each other better ** a few things about myself : * i'm quite an easy-going flexible and up-for-anything kind of guy * i'm an activities-oriented person preferably doing something together and cherishing the experience * i'm not really into drinking and do n't smoke however i can drink on occasion for social reasons it's just not my activity of choice * i would consider myself an introverted person but i can definitely open up to someone i trust in i prefer hanging out in one-on-one scenarios or small 2-4 person groups where people can interact and focus on each other well i try to avoid large social gatherings and parties with strangers as they're not my thing * i stay away from social media as much as possible the only thing close to social media that i use is reddit and i try to limit my time on it as well * enjoy live and online comedy last year i saw trevor noah's standup set at new york comedy festival went to ucb improv for the first time and checked out a comedy club in greenwich village you'll frequently find me listening to chris d'elias congratulations podcast or binge watching key & peele clips on youtube * i'm a big fan of art not too long ago visited the biennial and lichtenstein exhibition at the whitney went to david lynch's solo exhibit on bowery saw yayoi kusama's infinity room not worth plus many other galleries also love to visit art museums abroad just got back from checking out the van gogh museum and rijksmuseum in the netherlands plus the berggruen and berlinische museums in germany very much looking forward to visiting switzerland and poland to check out some exhibits i'm dying to see i've recently been trying to do my own art too primarily experimenting with printmaking and watercolors * been hiking a few times this past fall to check out the foliage in nj parks i really enjoy walking and prefer to do so when time allows i'm always up for having a walk in the park and around the city it's one of my favorite pastimes * went to a taping of seth meyers late night and late show with stephen colbert also been to the jimmy fallon show in the past and other tv show tapings i enjoy these one-off and unique experiences from time to time * enjoy traveling and visited japan netherlands luxembourg and germany in the last year if we hit it off then i'd definitely be looking forward to traveling together in the future * other random events i've attended the past few months are sumo & sushi indoor go-karting alvin ailey dance performance the moth storytelling's shin lim's magic show and art battle nyc just a taste of the different activities i like to take part in and explore * big fan of lesser known and independent movies you'd often see me at the smaller cinemas in town such as angelika ifc center metrograph and east village enjoy all kind of films including foreign and documentaries some movies i've seen recently are parasite a hidden life dark waters marriage story fantastic planet knives out weathering with you uncut gems mishima 1917 the lighthouse the farewell color out of space and the rescue * enjoy watching live sports including basketball soccer football baseball hockey bull riding air racing and so on these are all events i've gone to see locally and abroad recently attended a bundesliga match in berlin and this year i'm also looking forward to the checking out the world series of darts at msg * used to be a heavy gamer back in the day but do n't have as much time for it anymore nowadays mostly play mobile games on the go but still a big gamer at heart would love if you can bring that out of me once again i enjoy playing multiplayer games with friends i've also been to many esports events in the city over the years including overwatch finals league of legends world finals esl one csgo and dota2 tournaments rocket league finals and so on * heavily into music and live concerts this is a big hobby of mine and i highly enjoy it so i would love it if you do as well or at least willing to give it a try i'm the type of person who'll go to a concert stand in the front and have a good time i've attended too many shows the past couple of years to list but i listen to all types of music already planning to see a few this year some concerts i've been to in the past : * tool * smashing pumpkins * joe hisaishi studio ghibli composer * of montreal * cigarettes after sex * rolling stones * ed sheeran * of monsters and men * the head and the heart * explosions in the sky * muse * hans zimmer * babymetal * honne * anderson .paak * florence and the machine * beck * cage the elephant * wu-tang clan * jethro tull * radiohead * bone thugs n harmony * adele * sia * royal blood * animals as leaders * king princess * pink floyd * snarky puppy * queens of the stone age * cinematic orchestra * robert glasper * lauren hill * kings of leon * foo fighters * novo amor * jason mraz * twenty one pilots * panic at the disco * fall out boy * justice * gesaffelstein * trombone shorty * misterwives * the black keys * nerve * the strokes * dj shadow * ningen isu * and so on ... * other miscellaneous things i like : bubble tea been to most places around the city anime in moderation photography like to take out my dslr sometimes to shoot city landscapes parks and people foodie absolutely not a picky eater at all i'll eat and try anything cooking although i have n't done it recently i do appreciate making a home-cooked meal broadway musicals been to many already but still quite a few i want to see looking forward to seeing sing street soon in short i'm open to anything and everything there's probably a bunch of things that i've missed or forgot to mention but i've written way too much already i can also be a homebody when i'm feeling too tired and can lie in bed all day watching movies and listening to music so do n't let all the outdoors activities scare you i'm willing to try any of the things you enjoy doing as well and partake in your hobbies/interests as much as my own what i'm looking for in a companion : * please be in the nj/nyc area as i'm not keen on starting a long-distance relationship i'm looking for a hangout partner after all as the title suggests i want someone that i can meet up in-person and spend quality time with but also someone to chat and text with casually throughout the day to keep things going ideally i would want our friendship to blossom into something more but there's no rush or pressure * i'm also looking for consistency this is a big deal to me i want someone who will be able to spend time together on a frequent basis not someone who i can only see or chat with once every couple months i know people have their own friends and family and i totally respect and understand that but i want to find someone who will be able to meet up quite often hopefully at least once a week or as our schedules allow that way we can build something meaningful and make a habit of going out and enjoying our time together you only get out of a friendship/relationship as much as you put in i know everyone has their own busy lives and schedules especially in nyc and it feels that people just do n't seem to have time for you but i'm willing to put in the time and effort if you are willing to do it as well so i need to find someone who is eager to meet more than once and keep consistent communication it might sound like i'm a bit clingy but in actuality i just enjoy making a deeper connection with another person through putting in the extra effort and making time for them i'm the type of person who prefers to have a few strong friendships rather than a bunch of meaningless and casual acquaintances * ideally you're somewhere between 18-40. i'm not really picky about age what's more important is that we share some common interests have playful and fun communication but most of all are enthusiastic about being active and getting to know one another and try new things * i'm attracted to cute petite women i'm 5'8'' myself so being the same height or under is ideal if any of this interests you please send me a dm telling me about yourself what you enjoy and anything you'd want me to know certainly willing to meet up for a bubble tea and chat to see where things go thanks for reading : d",

why i live in everyone ’ s favorite nyc fairytale neighborhood harlem were you expecting something else matt asked me to explain what it ’ s like to live in harlem ‘ what ’ s a nice girl like you doing in a neighborhood like that ’ he wondered he is not the first to ask my address spices up any nyc party conversation for example : a : “ what do you do ” b : “ i ’ m a digital strategist/textile designer/social media consultant/freak. ” a : “ oh that ’ s cool where do you live ” b : “ williamsburg/murray hill/east village you ” when i tell them where i live their eyes open wide they stammer and croak something involving the word “ gentrification. ” ah that single word allegedly rationalizing my residence but what if i actually just like it i assure them harlem is safe place to live mentioning a duane reade just opened three blocks from my apartment and they breathe a semi-sigh of relief — how did i get to harlem after i got accepted to grad school in nyc i made plans to live with one of my best friends from high school and college who was going to grad school at columbia i immediately booked a one-way ticket from tampa — my hometown — and told my roommate i trusted him completely to choose our new apartment i had no clue where i would be moving ; i was just so excited to make nyc my home my roommate sent me pictures of our future apartment and it was rental love at first sight i told him to sign on the spot the author on moving day after i told my uncle where my apartment was he has lived in nyc for over 30 years ; thus he acts just how you ’ d think he ripped me about 50 new assholes “ harlem are you crazy ” he asked “ do you know where that is do you know how dangerous it could be ” he wouldn ’ t stop making comparisons to my neighborhood and serpico and midnight cowboy and still hasn ’ t to this day the very next day he went to my neighborhood met my roommate for the first time and stood on my stoop for hours he walked around the neighborhood he talked to people on my block which i ’ m sincerely sad was not taped for my later entertainment he also walked around the neighborhood at night to give my father — his brother — a full report after he assured my dad the neighborhood wasn ’ t completely terrible but also pointing out the staircase in my building looked just like the one in a crack-den apartment in serpico he made me get mace which i still carry and named himself deputy commissioner of /u/i_keep_it_real_ ’ s security tepidly he gave three-fourths of his blessing i flew into jfk weeks later cabbed it to hamilton heights and promptly twirled about our beautiful big apartment carrie-style i went to explore the neighborhood which wasn ’ t scary to me at all it ’ s a mostly-dominican neighborhood complete with a mcdonalds that delivers only three blocks from my apartment sure i don ’ t live in carrie bradshaw ’ s new york but recently i realized that jay-z ’ s lyrics from “ empire state of mind ” are about my hood — yes that ’ s my mcdonald ’ s : i used to cop in harlem/all of my dominicanos right there up on broadway/brought me back to that mcdonald ’ s so no my neighborhood is not tribeca but it ’ s beautiful and cool in its own right i found my favorite places to eat and walk within time i ’ ve seen every ethnicity in my neighborhood : students families and everyone else – if i feel safe in harlem what is the lingering stigma about harlem that makes people scared for me first frankly it ’ s because i ’ m not a big black thug second there ’ s the crime history third i think harlem makes people think of a lone tumbleweed rolling down a deserted street landing at the door of a shady pawn shop do i feel safe i never haven ’ t here ’ s why : in new york everyone is crazy in some way — from larry david to michael bloomberg so if you go into any new york neighborhood under the assumption that everyone is crazy you will always have your guard up and your eyes forward do i get whistled at in the street “ ay mama ” sure but it ’ s no different than assholes in their first suits from barneys in financial district bars are thinking so it really doesn ’ t matter to me my roommate is muscular and black so when we walk down the street together people assume we ’ re just another hip racially mixed couple to not mess with we ’ re not he ’ s gay i like to pretend we ’ re lady gaga and usher taking a stroll just living our lives like my roommate and i harlem is eccentric it ’ s an urban norman rockwell painting tucked away next to the hudson river old men play chess on the sidewalks on overturned milk crates my dry cleaning guy waves at me every morning cheerfully sweeping his stoop in a wifebeater and tube socks as opposed to many other manhattan neighborhoods there are no women on macrobiotic diets dictating to nannies on the sidewalks on the contrary women in my neighborhood let their husbands have it in the middle of the street often wearing tropical-colored get-ups everyone is loony in their own charming way – there ’ s more to my neighborhood than its diversity from a girlish perspective my apartment features crown molding exposed brick and a washer/dryer in my bathroom from a real estate perspective the pre-war architecture of my neighborhood is incredible i don ’ t live in a shoebox and the rent is reasonable and from a thug perspective my address lends me a bit of street cred the cashier at my bodega says i keep it real jay-z and frank serpico have probably been here photo by author besides the duane reade alexander hamilton ’ s mansion is five minutes away the best pizza i ’ ve ever had — from a place that really does look like it was in serpico – is two blocks away and the biggest most authentic burritos i ’ ve ever had are across the street the west side highway jogging path and riverside park are a hop and a skip on hot days women sell shaved ice on the corner little kids play in the water of an open fire hydrant during summer a breathless homeless woman is always posted up at the liquor store 62 steps from my front stoop : “ canyouspareadollarcanyouspareadollar… ” – in some ways moving to harlem on a whim was like a drunken vegas wedding everyone thought would get annulled “ but i love it ” i wailed to my parents almost three years later harlem and i are still going strong it ’ s true — they say when you know you know carrie and samantha once had this exchange on sex and the city : carrie says “ i have to go to san francisco on a book tour. ” samantha replies “ you wouldn ’ t go to the upper west side suddenly you ’ re going to san francisco ” and ramona from real housewives made an inference that women brawl on the street 10 blocks north of me my reply : what the hell is wrong with the west side carrie and guess what the scariest thing is at the corner of 150th ramona a taco bell and a kfc yes i ’ m a girl who stereotypically doesn ’ t fit the bill to live here and i do love having girlish brunches downtown and am envious of people who live near gramercy park—but that doesn ’ t mean i can ’ t prevail in harlem nah mean /u/i_keep_it_real_ is an editorial assistant for advance publication ’ s reddit.com she does

studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you ’ d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you ’ d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you ’ d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have",

        "Once a bohemian, funky neighborhood of artists and hippies, the East Village has followed the general upward trend of lower Manhattan and now features luxury condos and upscale eateries. Still, it retains a grungy, indy vibe compared to many other Manhattan areas and is an incredibly vibrant neighborhood.<br> If you're looking for something peaceful and quiet, this is probably not the neighborhood for you. But if you like having a ton of stuff to do within a few minutes from home, then it could be just right. The East Village has hundreds of restaurants and bars, a number of theaters (cinema, stage, and live music), unique stores, and tattoo parlors. And it got its own brewery in 2012 to satiate the thirst of its hipster residents.<br> Housing mostly consists of old walkup brownstone and townhome apartments on the smaller side (and by smaller, we mean say goodbye to that queen bed unless you've got some serious cash), although new development is bringing more lux homes to the area.<br> The East Village is bordered on the north by Gramercy Park and Stuyvesant Town, on the east by the East River, on the south by the Bowery and Lower East Side, and on the west by NoHo.",

        "Financial District is a neighborhood in New York City, New York with a population of 25,965. Financial District is in New York County and is one of the best places to live in New York. Living in Financial District offers residents a dense urban feel and most residents rent their homes. In Financial District there are a lot of bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and parks. Many young professionals live in Financial District and residents tend to be liberal. The public schools in Financial District are above average.",

        "This is a growing area and I expect that services will increase are it grows.",
        "Battery Park is a great area for walking or biking. There are a number of local gyms and everyone walks everywhere.",
        "Extraordinary public transportation is available within a two block walking distance of my building. I can get anywhere in Manhattan or Brooklyn in minutes.",
        "The Financial DIstrict is growing rapidly and there are a lot of job coming with that growth -- new companies, new restaurants, new small businesses.",
        "Being right around the corner from World Trade, there are cops everywhere constantly. Emergency responders are very quick and reliable. I always feel safe here.",
        "Because the 9/11 Memorial is located across the street, there is an enormous police presence in the area. As a result, I feel safe walking in the area at any time of the day or night (something that is unusual in Manhattan).",
        "Great place, very shady so there is usually a nice breeze and the fulton center is great. Only downside is not being able to control who exactly is on the streets.. There can be some strange people wandering the streets, but it is a cool place.",
        "It is great. there are a lot of sights to see. I like all the stores that I can shop. It is where I call home. It is my part of the city.",
        "I like how close the financial district was to my home. There are many options for food very close by and some drinks options nearby",
        "The Financial District is a great place if you are interested in living in proximity to dense and bustling Manhattan without necessarily living in it. Unlike the rest of Manhattan which can be a bit dense and overwhelming FiDi is much more relaxed and spread out. There are less people and less crowded streets. Traffic quiets down significantly after 5pm. Because the island of Manhattan tapers towards the south the land is not as wide and you feel as if you are surrounded by the river on numerous sides. I like that several subway lines converge in the part of the city providing easy and quick access to anywhere else. There is a bit of tourism but nothing bothersome. Attractions in the area are the South Street Seaport, Stone Street restaurants/bars/pubs, Trinity Church, The World Trade Center & Oculus, and Battery Park. Generally I like living there because there is enough business and entertainment to satisfy you and you quickly get to other parts of the city for even better options.",
        "The Financial District is very unique in that is not like stereotypical New York City. It is inhabited by a lot of business people and college students, and has its own little neighborhood feel. A lot of the stores in this area close rather early, though, an issue for the typical New Yorker. It's like its own environment yet still in extremely close proximity to everything you'd need to access. \nA great place to live.",
        "financial district is an upcoming neighborhood. very homie. apartment spaces are huge and with a lot of light. This is hard to find in new york. new restaurants and coffee shops recently opened creating more life. Close to the river for a good run or enjoy the view during good weather season.",
        "I love living in the Financial District. I always have access to any part of the city. Almost every subway line stops through Fulton Station. The area is super safe, and I have never felt threatened coming home. There are three grocery stores walking distance, and many give student discounts. It's a younger crowd living in this area because Pace University is right here.",

why i live in everyone ’ s favorite nyc fairytale neighborhood harlem were you expecting something else matt asked me to explain what it ’ s like to live in harlem ‘ what ’ s a nice girl like you doing in a neighborhood like that ’ he wondered he is not the first to ask my address spices up any nyc party conversation for example : a : “ what do you do ” b : “ i ’ m a digital strategist/textile designer/social media consultant/freak. ” a : “ oh that ’ s cool where do you live ” b : “ williamsburg/murray hill/east village you ” when i tell them where i live their eyes open wide they stammer and croak something involving the word “ gentrification. ” ah that single word allegedly rationalizing my residence but what if i actually just like it i assure them harlem is safe place to live mentioning a duane reade just opened three blocks from my apartment and they breathe a semi-sigh of relief — how did i get to harlem after i got accepted to grad school in nyc i made plans to live with one of my best friends from high school and college who was going to grad school at columbia i immediately booked a one-way ticket from tampa — my hometown — and told my roommate i trusted him completely to choose our new apartment i had no clue where i would be moving ; i was just so excited to make nyc my home my roommate sent me pictures of our future apartment and it was rental love at first sight i told him to sign on the spot the author on moving day after i told my uncle where my apartment was he has lived in nyc for over 30 years ; thus he acts just how you ’ d think he ripped me about 50 new assholes “ harlem are you crazy ” he asked “ do you know where that is do you know how dangerous it could be ” he wouldn ’ t stop making comparisons to my neighborhood and serpico and midnight cowboy and still hasn ’ t to this day the very next day he went to my neighborhood met my roommate for the first time and stood on my stoop for hours he walked around the neighborhood he talked to people on my block which i ’ m sincerely sad was not taped for my later entertainment he also walked around the neighborhood at night to give my father — his brother — a full report after he assured my dad the neighborhood wasn ’ t completely terrible but also pointing out the staircase in my building looked just like the one in a crack-den apartment in serpico he made me get mace which i still carry and named himself deputy commissioner of /u/i_keep_it_real_ ’ s security tepidly he gave three-fourths of his blessing i flew into jfk weeks later cabbed it to hamilton heights and promptly twirled about our beautiful big apartment carrie-style i went to explore the neighborhood which wasn ’ t scary to me at all it ’ s a mostly-dominican neighborhood complete with a mcdonalds that delivers only three blocks from my apartment sure i don ’ t live in carrie bradshaw ’ s new york but recently i realized that jay-z ’ s lyrics from “ empire state of mind ” are about my hood — yes that ’ s my mcdonald ’ s : i used to cop in harlem/all of my dominicanos right there up on broadway/brought me back to that mcdonald ’ s so no my neighborhood is not tribeca but it ’ s beautiful and cool in its own right i found my favorite places to eat and walk within time i ’ ve seen every ethnicity in my neighborhood : students families and everyone else – if i feel safe in harlem what is the lingering stigma about harlem that makes people scared for me first frankly it ’ s because i ’ m not a big black thug second there ’ s the crime history third i think harlem makes people think of a lone tumbleweed rolling down a deserted street landing at the door of a shady pawn shop do i feel safe i never haven ’ t here ’ s why : in new york everyone is crazy in some way — from larry david to michael bloomberg so if you go into any new york neighborhood under the assumption that everyone is crazy you will always have your guard up and your eyes forward do i get whistled at in the street “ ay mama ” sure but it ’ s no different than assholes in their first suits from barneys in financial district bars are thinking so it really doesn ’ t matter to me my roommate is muscular and black so when we walk down the street together people assume we ’ re just another hip racially mixed couple to not mess with we ’ re not he ’ s gay i like to pretend we ’ re lady gaga and usher taking a stroll just living our lives like my roommate and i harlem is eccentric it ’ s an urban norman rockwell painting tucked away next to the hudson river old men play chess on the sidewalks on overturned milk crates my dry cleaning guy waves at me every morning cheerfully sweeping his stoop in a wifebeater and tube socks as opposed to many other manhattan neighborhoods there are no women on macrobiotic diets dictating to nannies on the sidewalks on the contrary women in my neighborhood let their husbands have it in the middle of the street often wearing tropical-colored get-ups everyone is loony in their own charming way – there ’ s more to my neighborhood than its diversity from a girlish perspective my apartment features crown molding exposed brick and a washer/dryer in my bathroom from a real estate perspective the pre-war architecture of my neighborhood is incredible i don ’ t live in a shoebox and the rent is reasonable and from a thug perspective my address lends me a bit of street cred the cashier at my bodega says i keep it real jay-z and frank serpico have probably been here photo by author besides the duane reade alexander hamilton ’ s mansion is five minutes away the best pizza i ’ ve ever had — from a place that really does look like it was in serpico – is two blocks away and the biggest most authentic burritos i ’ ve ever had are across the street the west side highway jogging path and riverside park are a hop and a skip on hot days women sell shaved ice on the corner little kids play in the water of an open fire hydrant during summer a breathless homeless woman is always posted up at the liquor store 62 steps from my front stoop : “ canyouspareadollarcanyouspareadollar… ” – in some ways moving to harlem on a whim was like a drunken vegas wedding everyone thought would get annulled “ but i love it ” i wailed to my parents almost three years later harlem and i are still going strong it ’ s true — they say when you know you know carrie and samantha once had this exchange on sex and the city : carrie says “ i have to go to san francisco on a book tour. ” samantha replies “ you wouldn ’ t go to the upper west side suddenly you ’ re going to san francisco ” and ramona from real housewives made an inference that women brawl on the street 10 blocks north of me my reply : what the hell is wrong with the west side carrie and guess what the scariest thing is at the corner of 150th ramona a taco bell and a kfc yes i ’ m a girl who stereotypically doesn ’ t fit the bill to live here and i do love having girlish brunches downtown and am

Stone Street, the cobblestone alley known for its restaurants, is considered the first paved street in the city, and the Charging Bull statue in front of Bowling Green is one of the city’s most iconic landmarks.",
        "Great views, high-rises buildings, and New Yorkers who enjoy the beauty of living on the edge of Manhattan.",
        "The Financial District feels like an urban oasis as it sits at the confluence of the Hudson and East River.",
        "Congested weekdays due to the 9-to-5 hustle, and easygoing nights and weekends along the water.",
        "During the day, the Financial District is crowded as New Yorkers travel to work at this major commerce center.",
        "Active nightlife right outside your door.",
        "Energetic nightlife exists in pockets of the area, but most blocks cater to residential or office buildings.",
        "Great value in luxury and high-rise buildings.",
        "With a mix of walk-ups and luxury buildings, FiDi has a wealth of quality real-estate options for a variety of budgets.",
        "The architecture: glossy skyscrapers and cobblestone streets set against breathtaking ocean views.",
        "In the Financial District, seemingly conflicting architecture combines to create one of the most beautiful skylines in the city. Sleek, towering skyscrapers loom as an impressive reminder of the city’s commercial might.",
        "The heart of America's financial services industry quiets down after dark.",
        "The Financial District – sometimes abbreviated to FiDi – is the epicenter of business in New York City. Wall Street, the New York Stock Exchange, the famous bull statue, the new World Trade Center…it's all here. This neighborhood is full of financial services companies, skyscrapers, and people in dark suits.<br> It wasn’t long ago that this area would become a ghost town after the working day ended and people went back to their homes elsewhere. But in recent years tons of money has been invested in the area, bringing in new Starchitect-designed residential buildings, restaurants, and shops, and it's become an appealing place to live, particularly for those who work nearby.<br> This is a cultural hub for New York, as well. You've got the rebuilt World Trade Center, the 9/11 museum and memorial, Trinity Church (the oldest in Manhattan), the revolutionary era Fraunces Tavern, National Museum of the American Indian, and the historic South Street Seaport, whose cobblestone streets are home to a mall, exhibition space, boutiques, and restaurants. When you're in the mood for something mellower you can walk over to Battery Park and watch the ferries shuttle tourists to the Statue of Liberty.<br> The Financial District is bordered on the north by Tribeca and Civic Center, on the east and south by the East River, and on the west by Battery Park City.",
        "Best known as the financial services hub of New York City, FiDi is becoming increasingly residential.  People are flocking to the area drawn by the convenient transportation, newly renovated apartments, and striking waterfront views. ",
        "During the day, the Financial District can be chaotic with an influx of office workers and tourists attracted to the many historical sites, museums, and phenomenal views the neighborhood offers.  After the workday crowds clear, the neighborhood becomes quiet and calm.  Nightlife is confined to a few small areas, as most residents return to their amenity-rich buildings and rooftop patios. ",
        "Although Fidi is packed with office workers and civil servants by day, it completely empties out at night offering a handful of post-work happy hours. ",
        "Stone Street is a pedestrian-only cobblestone strip where you can find tons of pubs and happy hour specials. ",
        "FiDi is full of windy, narrow cobblestone streets that seem more akin to medieval Europe than Downtown Manhattan. ",
        "FiDi has incredible public transportation options offering access to practically every subway line. ",
        "During the evening hours, the neighborhood can feel low energy to some people because of the lack of traditional housing stock and amenities. ",
        "Prices in the Financial District are slightly less expensive relative to other Downtown Manhattan neighborhoods, but more and more luxury tier condos and rentals are coming on the market. ",
        "The Financial District is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Manhattan.  Its cobblestone streets date back to before the Revolution, and its office buildings are some of the city's first examples of skyscrapers. The Financial District is littered with landmarks from historic points of interest like Federal Hall where George Washington was sworn in as president to modern monuments and sculptures. There are plenty of elegant dining options, including Delmonico's, as well as casual spots where you can grab a beer and relax. The Financial District often conjures images of cavernous canyons of concrete and looming glassy gray facades, but the neighborhood has amazing access to the waterfront and its many bike paths and plazas. Packed with tourists and business people, FiDi is not your typical residential neighborhood, but it offers great subway access and proximity to just about everything. "

        "advice are you moving this winter read this i know how difficult moving in the winter can be going out there when it's freezing cold to see apartments is no fun i work in real estate so i've used my experience plus the most recent advice posts on r/nycapartments to create this small q & a for people moving this winter : **first question most people ask -** where do i live which is the safest neighborhood where are the cheapest apartments - let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you ’ d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you ’ d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you ’ d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have",

        "In the mid-1990s, the Flatiron District was known for its commercial real estate. Offices, department stores, and big-box retailers dotted the avenues between Union Square and Madison Square Park.",
        "A convenient neighborhood close to Union Square and Midtown with plenty of options for public transportation.",
        "Flatiron’s central location makes it a convenient neighborhood for commuting to other parts of the city. Union Square is a major hub for public transportation and other subways are within close walking distance.",
        "Fast-paced during the day and on the weekends, anchored by Union Square and great dining. Relatively quiet and mellow at night.",
        "By day, Flatiron is defined by the 9-to-5 hustle. The streets are packed with people on their way to work in one of the many office buildings in the neighborhood.",
        "A quiet neighborhood free of foot traffic.",
        "The streets of Flatiron can become fairly congested during the day and on the weekend. You might want to try and avoid the neighborhood if you’re averse to loud and busy foot and street traffic.",
        "Pricey with very low vacancy rates. Luxury buildings with brand-new amenities, and a few walk-ups buildings.",
        "Because Flatiron is predominantly a commercial neighborhood, there are fewer options for apartments than other places in the city. The neighborhood has a fair number of recently developed luxury buildings on Broadway, Park Avenue, and Fifth Avenue. They often come with all-inclusive gyms, rooftops, and doorman service, but also come with hefty price tags.",
        "Historic preservation in the middle of busy Manhattan.",
        "Flatiron has grown from an industrial neighborhood centered around one major architectural landmark into a residential area teeming with historic significance and cultural pride.",
        "An iconic building, a great park, and a foodie's paradise.",
        "The Flatiron District is a tiny neighborhood in Manhattan named after the iconic triangular Flatiron Building, constructed in 1902. This area is home to a vibrant mix of office buildings, boutiques, department stores, famed restaurants, elegant brownstone homes, and new residential towers.<br> It's got a lot of offer. You can grab a burger from the original Shake Shack and enjoy the people watching as you hang out in Madison Square Park. Celebrity chef Mario Batali's popular Eataly market is a great place to shop for groceries or eat your way through all the food stalls. For more upscale dining options, try Gramercy Tavern and Eleven Madison Park. There are plenty of banks, pharmacies, dry cleaners, and other everyday conveniences within walking distance, and a number of subway lines make stops in this neighborhood, providing an easy commute downtown or uptown.<br> The Flatiron District is bordered on the north by NoMad, on the east by Gramercy Park, on the south by Greenwich Village, and on the west by Chelsea.",
        "A fast-paced neighborhood perched between Downtown and Midtown Manhattan, the Flatiron District is always lively, and bursting with great shopping and restaurants. ",
        "Flatiron is a historic New York City neighborhood that has seen its fair share of change over the years.  In the early 1900s, it was a major commercial and residential center.  By the middle of the century, things stagnated as businesses and residents left in search of more space and lower rents.  In recent years, stores, upscale restaurants, and new developments moved back in, and the neighborhood is seeing a significant resurgence.   Fifth Avenue now bustles with some of the best shopping in the city, and restaurants run the gamut from Michelin-rated to Yelp-reviewed food trucks.  Flatiron is busiest at midday and cocktail hour and tends to quiet down a bit at night, although the lights never truly turn off.  Proximity to Union Square and multiple subway lines make it an equally easy trip to Midtown or Downtown. ",
        "Lots of commercial activity makes the Flatiron a vibrant destination for both locals and tourists. ",
        "With rotating art installations, oval lawn concerts, and the ever-bustling Shake Shack, Madison Square Park is a central destination for all Flatiron residents. ",
        "The historic Flatiron building (home to Macmillan Publishers, along with many other businesses) is so-called because it was built on a plot of land shaped like a “flat iron. ”",
        "Historic preservation has been a priority for residents of the Flatiron District, and as a result, the neighborhood boasts impressive cast-iron and beaux-art architecture. ",
        "The neighborhood is expensive, with a low turnover rate.  Most units are available in modern doorman buildings, although there are a few walk-ups as well. ",
        "Flatiron is a geographically small neighborhood that historically has had more commercial real estate than residential.  In recent years, that has changed as luxury new developments move in and former lofts are converted to upscale apartments. ",
        "Flatiron is a busy commercial center with tons of shopping along 5th Avenue and a growing tech scene. The architecture in Flatiron is some of the best in the city.  Look up and you will be awed by the ornate detail and beauty that characterizes the facades of the buildings. Madison Square Park is a favorite destination for take-out lunches and strolls through the park's rotating installations. The lines for Shake Shack at the Madison Square Park are notorious.  There's even a live stream for avid fans to track the status of crowds. "

        "Gramercy is a neighborhood in New York City, New York with a population of 20,060. Gramercy is in New York County and is one of the best places to live in New York. Living in Gramercy offers residents a dense urban feel and most residents rent their homes. In Gramercy there are a lot of bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and parks. Many young professionals live in Gramercy and residents tend to be liberal. The public schools in Gramercy are above average.",
        "There are a lot of workers in the area of many companies and many industries. Its a great place to look but there is not affordable living near this area so that must be kept in mind.",
        "The area has a great night life but I would like to see less homeless and psychologically impaired in the streets and out into a shelter",
        "My experience from living this past year at my school’s dorms in Gramercy was very positive. \nA walking distance from the east village and Chelsea, living in Gramercy feels like a nice and quiet place that is also close to all the hip and growing areas in the city. The Gramercy Park is one of the most beautiful getaways in the city, but only residents of this area are allowed to get in with a unique key. You’ll have to walk to the East Village for the cool bars, although there some moderate bars around Gramercy. Overall I believe that this area fits most for students or families.",
        "Gramercy is a diverse area, full of friendly residents, including college students, local businesses, and art.",

        "I lived in Stuyvesant Town and later in Peter Cooper Village and both are fantastic. I loved the area and both provide easy access to express buses uptown and cross town, L at 14th street, and 4,5,6 trains. PCV and Stuyuvesant Town are possibly the best value apartments in the whole city. The grounds around PCV and Stuy Town are wonderful and super dog and family friendly. It's amazing to be able to live in such a quiet, calm area tucked into such a chaotic city. ",

designer/social media consultant/freak. ” a : “ oh that ’ s cool where do you live ” b : “ williamsburg/murray hill/east village you ” when i tell them where i live their eyes open wide they stammer and croak something involving the word “ gentrification. ” ah that single word allegedly rationalizing my residence but what if i actually just like it i assure them harlem is safe place to live mentioning a duane reade just opened three blocks from my apartment and they breathe a semi-sigh of relief — how did i get to harlem after i got accepted to grad school in nyc i made plans to live with one of my best friends from high school and college who was going to grad school at columbia i immediately booked a one-way ticket from tampa — my hometown — and told my roommate i trusted him completely to choose our new apartment i had no clue where i would be moving ; i was just so excited to make nyc my home my roommate sent me pictures of our future apartment and it was rental love at first sight i told him to sign on the spot the author on moving day after i told my uncle where my apartment was he has lived in nyc for over 30 years ; thus he acts just how you ’ d think he ripped me about 50 new assholes “ harlem are you crazy ” he asked “ do you know where that is do you know how dangerous it could be ” he wouldn ’ t stop making comparisons to my neighborhood and serpico and midnight cowboy and still hasn ’ t to this day the very next day he went to my neighborhood met my roommate for the first time and stood on my stoop for hours he walked around the neighborhood he talked to people on my block which i ’ m sincerely sad was not taped for my later entertainment he also walked around the neighborhood at night to give my father — his brother — a full report after he assured my dad the neighborhood wasn ’ t completely terrible but also pointing out the staircase in my building looked just like the one in a crack-den apartment in serpico he made me get mace which i still carry and named himself deputy commissioner of /u/i_keep_it_real_ ’ s security tepidly he gave three-fourths of his blessing i flew into jfk weeks later cabbed it to hamilton heights and promptly twirled about our beautiful big apartment carrie-style i went to explore the neighborhood which wasn ’ t scary to me at all it ’ s a mostly-dominican neighborhood complete with a mcdonalds that delivers only three blocks from my apartment sure i don ’ t live in carrie bradshaw ’ s new york but recently i realized that jay-z ’ s lyrics from “ empire state of mind ” are about my hood — yes that ’ s my mcdonald ’ s : i used to cop in harlem/all of my dominicanos right there up on broadway/brought me back to that mcdonald ’ s so no my neighborhood is not tribeca but it ’ s beautiful and cool in its own right i found my favorite places to eat and walk within time i ’ ve seen every ethnicity in my neighborhood : students families and everyone else – if i feel safe in harlem what is the lingering stigma about harlem that makes people scared for me first frankly it ’ s because i ’ m not a big black thug second there ’ s the crime history third i think harlem makes people think of a lone tumbleweed rolling down a deserted street landing at the door of a shady pawn shop do i feel safe i never haven ’ t here ’ s why : in new york everyone is crazy in some way — from larry david to michael bloomberg so if you go into any new york neighborhood under the assumption that everyone is crazy you will always have your guard up and your eyes forward do i get whistled at in the street “ ay mama ” sure but it ’ s no different than assholes in their first suits from barneys in financial district bars are thinking so it really doesn ’ t matter to me my roommate is muscular and black so when we walk down the street together people assume we ’ re just another hip racially mixed couple to not mess with we ’ re not he ’ s gay i like to pretend we ’ re lady gaga and usher taking a stroll just living our lives like my roommate and i harlem is eccentric it ’ s an urban norman rockwell painting tucked away next to the hudson river old men play chess on the sidewalks on overturned milk crates my dry cleaning guy waves at me every morning cheerfully sweeping his stoop in a wifebeater and tube socks as opposed to many other manhattan neighborhoods there are no women on macrobiotic diets dictating to nannies on the sidewalks on the contrary women in my neighborhood let their husbands have it in the middle of the street often wearing tropical-colored get-ups everyone is loony in their own charming way – there ’ s more to my neighborhood than its diversity from a girlish perspective my apartment features crown molding exposed brick and a washer/dryer in my bathroom from a real estate perspective the pre-war architecture of my neighborhood is incredible i don ’ t live in a shoebox and the rent is reasonable and from a thug perspective my address lends me a bit of street cred the cashier at my bodega says i keep it real jay-z and frank serpico have probably been here photo by author besides the duane reade alexander hamilton ’ s mansion is five minutes away the best pizza i ’ ve ever had — from a place that really does look like it was in serpico – is two blocks away and the biggest most authentic burritos i ’ ve ever had are across the street the west side

woman is always posted up at the liquor store 62 steps from my front stoop : “ canyouspareadollarcanyouspareadollar… ” – in some ways moving to harlem on a whim was like a drunken vegas wedding everyone thought would get annulled “ but i love it ” i wailed to my parents almost three years later harlem and i are still going strong it ’ s true — they say when you know you know carrie and samantha once had this exchange on sex and the city : carrie says “ i have to go to san francisco on a book tour. ” samantha replies “ you wouldn ’ t go to the upper west side suddenly you ’ re going to san francisco ” and ramona from real housewives made an inference that women brawl on the street 10 blocks north of me my reply : what the hell is wrong with the west side carrie and guess what the scariest thing is at the corner of 150th ramona a taco bell and a kfc yes i ’ m a girl who stereotypically doesn ’ t fit the bill to live here and i do love having girlish brunches downtown and am

        "advice are you moving this winter read this i know how difficult moving in the winter can be going out there when it's freezing cold to see apartments is no fun i work in real estate so i've used my experience plus the most recent advice posts on r/nycapartments to create this small q & a for people moving this winter : **first question most people ask -** where do i live which is the safest neighborhood where are the cheapest apartments - let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you ’ d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you ’ d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you ’ d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have",

Residents who shell out for the stately brownstone homes surrounding the park get keys to access it; it's open to the public for one hour each year on Christmas Eve. For the less privileged there is a nearby park with a playground and a separate dog run. There are also a number of schools within its borders that cater to the families here.<br> You'll find a good selection of dining options, ranging from laid back to gourmet. When it comes to nightlife, the area is fairly subdued compared to the adjacent neighborhood of the East Village. Sure, there are bars, taverns, and even a couple clubs, but it doesn't have the same mob of fresh-out-of-school adults – the clientele tend to be a little bit more mature.<br> Gramercy Park is bordered on the north by Rose Hill and Kips Bay, on the east by Stuyvesant Town, on the south by Greenwich Village and the East Village, and on the west by the Flatiron District.",
        "Just north and east of Union Square, Gramercy Park is a small, quiet residential enclave in the midst of one of the most urban sections of New York City. ",
        "In the early 20th century, Gramercy Park was synonymous with luxury.  Some of the most prominent New Yorkers lived in grand houses along the neighborhood's eponymous park.  Today, Gramercy Park is a brief respite from the hustle and bustle of Downtown Manhattan that still retains an old-world vibe.  It's not uncommon to see residents dressed in tweed and loafers tottering down Irving Place, a quiet commercial stretch that offers a mix of local shops, restaurants, and pubs.  As you head further east, the avenues get busier and more generic.  Gramercy's side streets are lined with walk-ups and large apartment buildings and are more casual than the blocks surrounding the actual park, attracting residents looking for a quintessentially nice New York City neighborhood. ",
        "Quiet and laid-back, the streets of Gramercy Park are noticeably less congested than surrounding neighborhoods. ",
        "Gramercy Park is the neighborhood's namesake as well as its heart.  The lovely tree-lined blocks surrounding it boast an old-world mix of private clubs, upscale co-ops, and Greek Revival–style townhouses. ",
        "Gramercy Park itself is a private, gated space, and only residents who live on the park's perimeter have keys to get inside. ",
        "The neighborhood is very safe and boasts many doorman buildings.  It is also conveniently located to most subway lines and a quick walk to Union Square. ",
        "Real estate in the gorgeous Neo-Gothic and Greek Revival buildings does not come cheap. ",
        "The townhouses and tony co-op buildings along the park command some of the highest asking prices in the city.  As you head further east, you'll find more walk-ups and rentals, which are less expensive relative to the rest of neighborhood. ",
        "With tons of historic architecture and prestigious private clubs, Gramercy Park feels has a sophisticated, old-world feel. Keep your eyes peeled when you walk through the Gramercy neighborhood: There are tons of design details and gems to spot. As you head further east, the neighborhood takes on a more casual vibe.  Second and Third Avenues are lined with bars, restaurants, dry cleaners, and nail salons — the staples of a Manhattan professional's lifestyle. Irving Place is truly one of a kind.  No other street in the city combines its local, small-town ambiance with its classy, upscale offerings. "

        "Greenwich Village is a funky place. Tons of parades, tons of famous people, and tons of great places to eat.",
        "Greenwich Village is an incredible neighborhood in Manhattan that is absolutely perfect for students. As someone attending NYU, Greenwich offers the perfect mix of a pleasant residential neighborhood and the excitement of the city.",
        "The thing I loved the most about the Village is that you get a neighborhood that has almost everything you need, from bars to 24h drugstores, and is also very residential.",
        "Such a beautiful neighborhood that is a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of the more touristy areas.",
        "Fantastic and culturally interesting neighborhood. Beautiful architecture in a great location! Right by the hudson river!",
        "Awesome place to be for pizza lovers and foodies. There is a pizza place around every corner. Hippie culture is also very strong, so its a great place for misfits and wallflowers.",
        "I've lived the majority of my life in this neighborhood and overall, it is fantastic. I graduated from City and Country Middle School and am entering the Abraham Joshua Heschel High School. The Village is overwhelmingly liberal and there are many LGBTQ+ people living around because the LGBT Center is in the village. Sometimes walking past that area I feel uncomfortable because there are many homeless people living on that street. \nHowever, everything else is incredible. You can't live the same life uptown or even in midtown. Downtown in the meatpacking district is really the best.",
        "I was born into a family that has its roots buried deep into Greenwich Village. My grandfather, Mario Saulig, emigrated to Greenwich Village in 1955 from Italy and my family has lived here ever since. I went to public school in the Village and had a great time. The school was welcoming and friendly. I made friends with many of my neighbors at a young and continue to talk to them even as an 18 year old. I never feel that safety is an issue while in my neighborhood. I have come home well into the morning hours and had no more concern for my safety than if I were coming home at noon. My high school is located in Brooklyn, New York and every time I get off of the subway and see the brown historic district street signs I breath a sign of relief that I am home.",
        "The cost of living is very expensive, since it is New York city, but it is worth it. As a student, living in the Village has allowed me to experience all of New York city while still feeling like I live in a more small and homey community. I would want to live there for the rest of my life!",
        "When I first moved here I thought it was going to be loud and difficult to live here, but I've been surprised. The area I am in, while it sometimes can get noisy, is quite quiet. The parks around my apartment building always have workers cleaning and tending to the plants, which keeps the park very well-groomed. I have my choice of any type of cuisine I could desire, and I can have it delivered to my home, or walk there in a matter of minutes. And if I'm traveling somewhat far, all I have to do is step out the door to find a taxi or subway station.",

casual relationship at most a companion to have fun with and make an emotional & physical connection **i should mention this upfront to avoid wasting time if you're going to stop responding after a few days or a week then there's no point to dm me if you're unwilling or unlikely to actually meet up in person then also do n't bother the point of this post is to find someone to actually hang out with in real life one last thing do n't message me if the first question you will ask is `` do you have a pic'' i'm totally cool with exchanging pics after we've established a dialogue and have gotten to know each other better ** a few things about myself : * i'm quite an easy-going flexible and up-for-anything kind of guy * i'm an activities-oriented person preferably doing something together and cherishing the experience * i'm not really into drinking and do n't smoke however i can drink on occasion for social reasons it's just not my activity of choice * i would consider myself an

feeling too tired and can lie in bed all day watching movies and listening to music so do n't let all the outdoors activities scare you i'm willing to try any of the things you enjoy doing as well and partake in your hobbies/interests as much as my own what i'm looking for in a companion : * please be in the nj/nyc area as i'm not keen on starting a long-distance relationship i'm looking for a hangout partner after all as the title suggests i want someone that i can meet up in-person and spend quality time with but also someone to chat and text with casually throughout the day to keep things going ideally i would want our friendship to blossom into something more but there's no rush or pressure * i'm also looking for consistency this is a big deal to me i want someone who will be able to spend time together on a frequent basis not someone who i can only see or chat with once every couple months i know people have their own friends and family and i totally respect and understand that but i want to find someone who will be able to meet up quite often hopefully at least once a week or as our schedules allow that way we can build something meaningful and make a habit of going out and enjoying our time together you only get out of a friendship/relationship as much as you put in i know everyone has their own busy lives and schedules especially in nyc and it feels that people just do n't seem to have time for you but i'm willing to put in the time and effort if you are willing to do it as well so i need to find someone who is eager to meet more than once and keep consistent communication it might sound like i'm a bit clingy but in actuality i just enjoy making a deeper connection with another person through putting in the extra effort and making time for them i'm the type of person who prefers to have a few strong friendships rather than a bunch of meaningless and casual acquaintances * ideally you're somewhere between 18-40. i'm not really picky about age what's more important is that we share some common interests have playful and fun communication but most of all are enthusiastic about being active and getting to know one another and try new things * i'm attracted to cute petite women i'm 5'8'' myself so being the same height or under is ideal if any of this interests you please send me a dm telling me about yourself what you enjoy and anything you'd want me to know certainly willing to meet up for a bubble tea and chat to see where things go thanks for reading : d",

studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you ’ d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you ’ d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you ’ d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have",

        "This neighborhood is extremely family oriented most of us have known each other growing up, so through all negative circumstances we remain united. Most of the events in the community have come to an end years ago, due to the fact that our community center was shut down. Neighborhood trips and block parties were all established within the community center administration. I don't like the fact that we don't have a dog park because almost of us have pets. Some people are afraid of dogs so it would be useful to have an isolated area where pets can be walked and play. I also believe less loitering and trespassing would occur if NYCHA had security in building lobbies.",

There is also not much graffiti, or vandelism, maybe some homeless people steal some bread, or fruit but other than that it seems fine.",

        "The criminal activity in my neighborhood makes it unfortunate for anyone who lives there. There are typically police officers present during certain hours, however, many people are able to get around getting caught drinking or smoking on the premises.

On average, you will probably see at least one police car each day but that is common throughout the whole city. Sometimes you will see the police at subway stations. My safety concern pertains to groups of men always standing on the sidewalks at all times of the day and nights.",

Having lived in Harlem for all of my life, I can truly say that this neighborhood is very connected, meaning that the people who have been here for a long time are very welcoming to people who are just moving here. There are a lot of public transportation options throughout Harlem which makes it for a very fast commute time to anywhere in the five boroughs, to the airport, and many other places.",

There is so much history in these sidewalks and this culture pours out from the people like water from an open fire hydrant on a hot New York summer day. To live in this neighborhood is to feel the pulse of Community in a city of strangers. People here know their neighbors and care for them as if they were family. Harlem is home to many cultures that all coexist and support each other.",

        "Many people refer to Harlem as an \"affordable\" Manhattan neighborhood but this is only true when comparing it to downtown (and anything looks affordable compared to downtown Manhattan). There are very robust and diverse communities within Harlem (Spanish Harlem and Little Senegal for example).

        "There is still a sense of community in this neighborhood unlike the rest of New York City, where no one knows their neighbors. There is vast gentrification happening, which is both good and bad. Good because the neighborhood is a lot safer than what it used to be, and bad because it takes away part of that good old Harlem soul. What is left of a prominent jazz scene, diverse community of people of all different ethnic, racial, and economic backgrounds, bustling small businesses, and a general nice vibe. Can get a bit sketchy at night and can be full of odd characters, but I've never once felt deliberately unsafe.",
        "The restaurants and the community is amazing but sometimes I don't always feel safe. However, the amount of love that is radiating from here is awesome.",

        "If you work in the city and want to live in the city but can't afford it, Harlem is the next best thing. Rent prices are going up but I think it's pretty similar to some parts of Brooklyn and LIC. The 20 min commute to midtown is the best thing ever. There are multiple subway lines to get you to any part of the city. Food options are somewhat diverse but there is a heavy concentration of African American establishments. There are lots of bars and nightclubs (I never been to them so I can't give an informative review on them).  Harlem is very neighborly. I always receive warm and friendly greetings from familiar and unfamiliar faces. Crime is everywhere but I always feel safe walking around (even when walking my dog at 12am).",

        "Harlem is a place that is very different than most places. I love Harlem because there are so many different cultures that live here. For instance, you can find Puerto Rican, Dominican, Mexican, African, and Jamaican Food all within a 5 minute walk from each other. One thing that I somewhat dislike is that it can get very loud sometimes do to its large population.",
        "Every time I have the opportunity glance at the beauty of the historical streets of Harlem, it never fails to amazed me. The welcoming breeze that strikes every pore of your face, with a certain smell of fried chicken that would eventually lead people to covert as new customers of Popeye's, the colorful streets that copes along as the seasons transitions, the old structured buildings that takes anyone to a 90's movie, the concerts hosted by honks with a special collaboration of sirens, the countless waves of individuals, who's similarities cannot be seen with the bare eye. This numerous traits not only provides their tourist with unique free entertainment, but it also demonstrate why Harlem is the perfect example a veteran, who worked throughout years, and has finally received their retirement paycheck. I fell in love with this place, and if a tourist ever asked me what are some of the best areas in NYC Harlem would always be number one on my recommended list.",
        "I love Harlem! Despite my reservations. The people are friendly, easy access to the rest of NYC. However, the parks need to be redone and we need more businesses to take a chance on Harlem.",
        "my experiences in this part of town were very good. I lived in all around Harlem since 2011. The people, the culture, environment has/t been anything but great. slowly you would notice the gentrification happening around with fancy restaurants taking over small shops and bodegas. The sad truth but the neighborhood is good for raising families and living independently.",
        "Harlem is unclean with unpleasant odors.  Sadly, there are many addicts and homeless people on the streets. However, the location is convenient and there are free programs for children. There are also many restaurants to choose from.",

        "Its not great in many aspects still, but pricing in this particular area are good compared to the rest of the city (not to the country, however). It is getting better slowly in other aspects as well.",
        "Housing is sufficient in this community. However, as a Harlem resident for more than 10 years, abandoned or dilapidated houses are a consistent presence in this community and it has done very little in either renovating or demolishing such houses.",
        "There are apartment buildings with only 6 floors so its comfortable and management does a good job of making sure the buildings are clean. Although the rent could be a little more pricey then for what we get.",
        "The housing area is alright",
        "Short and sweet: walk-ups, million-dollar brownstones and duplexes, and old buildings converted into condos.",

        "my first suggestion would be to search for apartments based on whatever subway lines is closest to your school e.g anything that is nearby the subway stops along the the a b c d and 1 subway lines you can check on the mta's map here for what the closest stops are that way you wo n't have to worry about transferring from one train to another which is common for many on commuting to work myself included & nbsp ; ahead of all that you will definitely need to learn how to navigate the subway at some point in time there's no easy 1-2-3 guide for this and a youtube is probably faster but going by looking at the mta subway map plus the key shown there on the top-right corner plus when in doubt always ask a friendly face e.g an officer security any mta workers you come across booth agents anyone who is n't in a rush better to ask then to get lost below are my top few points when going anywhere by train at least & nbsp ; * technically every stop black and white dots is a **local stop** where all **local trains** stop at * white dots though mean that that stop is also an **express stop** these are the only stops **express trains** go to within that borough * and for both points above : these are not always true though on the weekends and/or due to never-ending construction so always check google maps the mta app and any other train-apps you use for help on how to navigate from one stop to another & nbsp ; for example take the 1/2/3 train lines these are the lines marked as red in the map notice how the 1 train is listed on every stop on the red line you can consider that the *local train* and look again to the white dots along the red lines see how they're marked as 2 or 3 this means the 2 and 3 are the *express trains* at least in manhattan once you go to another borough though like brooklyn at that point the trains can differ from being `` express'' in manhattan to `` local'' in brooklyn so again take a good look at the maps for where you need to go identify the trains you need and more importantly if lost ask someone & nbsp ; as for neighborhoods to look in i'd check anywhere within inwood washington heights upper west side uws and west of harlem anything nearby columbia university as starting points for your search if you're looking to stay along the 1 train",

why i live in everyone ’ s favorite nyc fairytale neighborhood harlem were you expecting something else matt asked me to explain what it ’ s like to live in harlem ‘ what ’ s a nice girl like you doing in a neighborhood like that ’ he wondered he is not the first to ask my address spices up any nyc party conversation for example : a : “ what do you do ” b : “ i ’ m a digital strategist/textile designer/social media consultant/freak. ” a : “ oh that ’ s cool where do you live ” b : “ williamsburg/murray hill/east village you ” when i tell them where i live their eyes open wide they stammer and croak something involving the word “ gentrification. ” ah that single word allegedly rationalizing my residence but what if i actually just like it i assure them harlem is safe place to live mentioning a duane reade just opened three blocks from my apartment and they breathe a semi-sigh of relief — how did i get to harlem after i got accepted to grad school in nyc i made plans to live with one of my best friends from high school and college who was going to grad school at columbia i immediately booked a one-way ticket from tampa — my hometown — and told my roommate i trusted him completely to choose our new apartment i had no clue where i would be moving ; i was just so excited to make nyc my home my roommate sent me pictures of our future apartment and it was rental love at first sight i told him to sign on the spot the author on moving day after i told my uncle where my apartment was he has lived in nyc for over 30 years ; thus he acts just how you ’ d think he ripped me about 50 new assholes “ harlem are you crazy ” he asked “ do you know where that is do you know how dangerous it could be ” he wouldn ’ t stop making comparisons to my neighborhood and serpico and midnight cowboy and still hasn ’ t to this day the very next day he went to my neighborhood met my roommate for the first time and stood on my stoop for hours he walked around the neighborhood he talked to people on my block which i ’ m sincerely sad was not taped for my later entertainment he also walked around the neighborhood at night to give my father — his brother — a full report after he assured my dad the neighborhood wasn ’ t completely terrible but also pointing out the staircase in my building looked just like the one in a crack-den apartment in serpico he made me get mace which i still carry and named himself deputy commissioner of /u/i_keep_it_real_ ’ s security tepidly he gave three-fourths of his blessing i flew into jfk weeks later cabbed it to hamilton heights and promptly twirled about our beautiful big apartment carrie-style i went to explore the neighborhood which wasn ’ t scary to me at all it ’ s a mostly-dominican neighborhood complete with a mcdonalds that delivers only three blocks from my apartment sure i don ’ t live in carrie bradshaw ’ s new york but recently i realized that jay-z ’ s lyrics from “ empire state of mind ” are about my hood — yes that ’ s my mcdonald ’ s : i used to cop in harlem/all of my dominicanos right there up on broadway/brought me back to that mcdonald ’ s so no my neighborhood is not tribeca but it ’ s beautiful and cool in its own right i found my favorite places to eat and walk within time i ’ ve seen every ethnicity in my neighborhood : students families and everyone else – if i feel safe in harlem what is the lingering stigma about harlem that makes people scared for me first frankly it ’ s because i ’ m not a big black thug second there ’ s the crime history third i think harlem makes people think of a lone tumbleweed rolling down a deserted street landing at the door of a shady pawn shop do i feel safe i never haven ’ t here ’ s why : in new york everyone is crazy in some way — from larry david to michael bloomberg so if you go into any new york neighborhood under the assumption that everyone is crazy you will always have your guard up and your eyes forward do i get whistled at in the street “ ay mama ” sure but it ’ s no different than assholes in their first suits from barneys in financial district bars are thinking so it really doesn ’ t matter to me my roommate is muscular and black so when we walk down the street together people assume we ’ re just another hip racially mixed couple to not mess with we ’ re not he ’ s gay i like to pretend we ’ re lady gaga and usher taking a stroll just living our lives like my roommate and i harlem is eccentric it ’ s an urban norman rockwell painting tucked away next to the hudson river old men play chess on the sidewalks on overturned milk crates my dry cleaning guy waves at me every morning cheerfully sweeping his stoop in a wifebeater and tube socks as opposed to many other manhattan neighborhoods there are no women on macrobiotic diets dictating to nannies on the sidewalks on the contrary women in my neighborhood let their husbands have it in the middle of the street often wearing tropical-colored get-ups everyone is loony in their own charming way – there ’ s more to my neighborhood than its diversity from a girlish perspective my apartment features crown molding exposed brick and a washer/dryer in my bathroom from a real estate perspective the pre-war architecture of my neighborhood is incredible i don ’ t live in a shoebox and the rent is reasonable and from a thug perspective my address lends me a bit of street cred the cashier at my bodega says i keep it real jay-z and frank serpico have probably been here photo by author besides the duane reade alexander hamilton ’ s mansion is five minutes away the best pizza i ’ ve ever had — from a place that really does look like it was in serpico – is two blocks away and the biggest most authentic burritos i ’ ve ever had are across the street the west side highway jogging path and riverside park are a hop and a skip on hot days women sell shaved ice on the corner little kids play in the water of an open fire hydrant during summer a breathless homeless woman is always posted up at the liquor store 62 steps from my front stoop : “ canyouspareadollarcanyouspareadollar… ” – in some ways moving to harlem on a whim was like a drunken vegas wedding everyone thought would get annulled “ but i love it ” i wailed to my parents almost three years later harlem and i are still going strong it ’ s true — they say when you know you know carrie and samantha once had this exchange on sex and the city : carrie says “ i have to go to san francisco on a book tour. ” samantha replies “ you wouldn ’ t go to the upper west side suddenly you ’ re going to san francisco ” and ramona from real housewives made an inference that women brawl on the street 10 blocks north of me my reply : what the hell is wrong with the west side carrie and guess what the scariest thing is at the corner of 150th ramona a taco bell and a kfc yes i ’ m a girl who stereotypically doesn ’ t fit the bill to live here and i do love having girlish brunches downtown and am

        "advice are you moving this winter read this i know how difficult moving in the winter can be going out there when it's freezing cold to see apartments is no fun i work in real estate so i've used my experience plus the most recent advice posts on r/nycapartments to create this small q & a for people moving this winter : **first question most people ask -** where do i live which is the safest neighborhood where are the cheapest apartments - let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you ’ d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you ’ d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you ’ d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have",

        "Harlem is one of New York City's most storied neighborhoods. Located in uptown Manhattan, this has traditionally been the core of the city's African American community and was the birthplace of the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s and 1930s that gave the world cultural greats like Langston Hughes, Josephine Baker, and Louis Armstrong. The iconic Apollo Theater, which has featured everyone from Ella Fitzgerald to the Jackson 5, still hosts comedy and musical acts today.<br> The area has seen hard times with high crime since those days, but has been on a path of gentrification for many years now. While crime is still a problem in some parts, overall it has dropped significantly in the past couple decades. <br> For housing, there is a mix of stately brownstones, large brick apartment complexes, smaller brick walk-ups, and government-subsidized housing. New development is bringing luxury condos to the market as well.<br> Most of Harlem's restaurants and nightlife tends to be clustered in the southern half of the neighborhood. You'll find a wide range of dining options, with several acclaimed new restaurants opening up in recent years. There are also a number of southern food joints that have become neighborhood institutions, like Sylvia's. The northern part of Harlem is fairly devoid of options besides fast food.<br> If you have children, it's worth noting that the public schools in the area are not very good. There are a handful of well-regarded charter schools here, but they use a lottery system to accept students so are very hard to get into.<br> Harlem has several parks offering athletic fields, dog runs, playgrounds, chess tables, and picnic areas. And you're not far from the sprawling Central Park and its 840 acres of amenities.<br> Harlem is bordered on the north by Washington Heights, on the east by the Harlem River and East Harlem, on the south by Central Park and the Upper West Side, and on the west by Morningside Heights, Manhattanville, and Hamilton Heights.",

Sylvia's has been the place for authentic Southern soul food in Harlem since 1962. Compared to the rest of the city, brownstones in Harlem are reasonably priced.  Also, the rents are relatively affordable. There is a lot of unexpected green space to counteract the urbanity of Harlem.

I generally feel safe and secure on a daily basis.",

        "I've lived here in Hell's Kitchen my whole life. It's a great neighborhood as within it are so many options for entertainment and fun, but as well as around it. There are many parks, restaurants, just places in general that you can enjoy yourself. Just a great place to live and be in, in general.",
        "I was born and raised in Hell's Kitchen and it will always be close to my heart. There is a large Puerto Rican population here and is full of culture. The annual 9th avenue festival just passed which is an international food festival. Hell's kitchen is also very close to Broadway, so you have easy access to it without constantly being surrounded by tourists.",
        "I just love this Neighborhood I plan to move to the area in the near future with the help and guidance of the all mighty Lord. Beautiful eateries and plenty to do. I would never be bored living here.",
        "Hell's Kitchen is a great neighborhood. It's in close proximity to all major public transportation routes: Port Authority, Penn Station, ACE/7 Trains, Bolt Bus; it is also in walking distance to the mecca of shopping in Manhattan: Hudson Yards, Herald Square, Times Square etc. There are lots of restaurants in the area, however my only critique is that there aren't enough vegan / vegetarian restaurants. There is only one supermarket in the area that I use called Brooklyn Fair. Though expensive, their selection is robust-- they also have the friendliest staff I have ever encountered. The area is quite loud, but living in Manhattan you can not expect any thing less. I always feel safe in my neighborhood, plus there is a precinct in the area on 35th and 9th avenue, so no worries on that front. With the opening of Hudson Yards and the extension of the Highline, the area's traffic will pick up a bit, however it's not overwhelming. Generally a great area to live in.",

        "Very diverse area with lots to do. Hopefully diversity and affordable living can become more attainable in the near future to promote inclusivity.",
        "This area manages to balance the neighborhood and outgoing scene perfectly. But for me, I'm not the most outgoing person and I prefer the more private neighborhood aspect. However, if you're on the other side of the spectrum and you're an extrovert and love the hustle and bustle New York City scene than this is the area for you. As soon as you step outside, you're swept into the city scene.",
        "Living in Hell's Kitchen, in my opinion, is satisfying and enjoyable. The Hudson River nearby serves as a great place for exercise and relaxation. There are many other resources that are family friendly, such as Central Park and Lincoln Center.  Being in the center of New York City grants my family and I convenient access to many different experiences in the city.",

It really is a great community with tons of restaurants, bars, parks and you can always bump into someone you know on Ninth Avenue, which is fun and social.\n\nIt's a great place for the gay community and gay allies as well!",
        "Hells Kitchen used to be one of the poorest neighborhoods in Manhattan. It has since, like many areas in New York, seen an influx of growth and development. There is old history here, as well as high rise condos. The tension represented by those opposite ends of the spectrum living together creates a surprising culture of acceptance. No matter where you came from, there's a place for you here. \n\nMy only complaint is that, not unlike many areas of large cities, it is often dirtier than I think it deserves because of the nightlife scene.",

        "several explanations exist for the original name hells kitchen an early use of the phrase appears in a comment davy crockett made about another notorious irish slum in manhattan five points according to the irish cultural society of the garden city area : when in 1835 davy crockett said `` in my part of the country when you meet an irishman you find a first-rate gentleman ; but these are worse than savages ; they are too mean to swab hell's kitchen'' he was referring to the five points according to an article by kirkley greenwell published online by the hell's kitchen neighborhood association : no one can pin down the exact origin of the label but some refer to a tenement on 54th street as the first `` hell's kitchen'' another explanation points to an infamous building at 39th as the true original a gang and a local dive took the name as well ... a similar slum also existed in london and was known as hell's kitchen local historian mary clark explained the name thus : ... first appeared in print on september 22 1881 when a new york times reporter went to the west 30s with a police guide to get details of a multiple murder there he referred to a particularly infamous tenement at 39th street and tenth avenue as `` hell's kitchen'' and said that the entire section was `` probably the lowest and filthiest in the city'' according to this version 39th street between 9th and 10th avenues became known as hell's kitchen and the name was later expanded to the surrounding streets another version ascribes the name's origins to a german restaurant in the area known as heil's kitchen after its proprietors but the most common version traces it to the story of `` dutch fred the cop'' a veteran policeman who with his rookie partner was watching a small riot on west 39th street near tenth avenue the rookie is supposed to have said `` this place is hell itself'' to which fred replied `` hell's a mild climate this is hell's kitchen'' hell's kitchen has stuck as the most-used name of the neighborhood even though real estate developers have offered alternatives of `` clinton'' and `` midtown west'' or even `` the mid-west'' the clinton name used by the municipality of new york city originated in 1959 in an attempt to link the area to dewitt clinton park at 52nd and eleventh avenue named after the 19th century new york governor",

let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you ’ d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you ’ d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you ’ d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have",

Its gritty reputation and far-west location kept it under the radar.  But today’s Hell’s Kitchen is a far cry from the image its name evokes.  In the past ten years, developers and small business owners have planted roots in this up-and-coming neighborhood.",
        "A neighborhood that has a little bit of everything: culture, entertainment, and convenience.",
        "In Hell’s Kitchen, the streets are saturated with local business across a spectrum of categories. Neighborhood-owned bakeries, bodegas, and bistros make it feel like a real community.",
        "Decidedly unpretentious: bustling streets, eclectic restaurants, and a welcoming atmosphere.",
        "In Hell’s Kitchen the streets always have a steady buzz about them, giving an energetic and spirited feel to the neighborhood.",
        "Anyone who hopes to escape the loud noise or congestion of Midtown.",
        "Depending on which part of Hell’s Kitchen you choose, you might have to become accustomed to the noise of thise Midtown neighborhoods. Port Authority and Times Square are nearby, which makes for tourists and travelers at all hours of the day.",
        "Mostly affordable walkups and doorman buildings, and newer luxury-high rise buildings.",
        "In Hell’s Kitchen zoning laws cap most buildings in the neighborhood to six stories, so homes tend to be in walk-ups, townhouses or brownstones.",
        "The way this up-and-coming neighborhood continues to evolve while staying close to its roots.",
        "Hell’s Kitchen has come a long way from its rough-and-tumble history. New developments and businesses are springing up throughout the neighborhood, and extending the skyline onward and upward.",
        "Hell's Kitchen is a vibrant, walkable neighborhood with easy access to the entire west side of Manhattan.",
        "Hell's Kitchen is an iconic neighborhood in west Midtown Manhattan known for its gritty history as a slum for poor Irish immigrants. Some developers and real estate agents have attempted to rebrand this area as \"Clinton\" to perhaps suggest a more idyllic place, but the name certainly doesn't keep people away: this is a popular neighborhood full of affluent young professionals.<br> Five-story brick walk-ups are the standard form of housing in Hell's Kitchen although there are plenty of newer residential towers in the neighborhood, particularly on the main avenues, and development on more continues. As it's gentrified over the past couple decades home prices have increased steadily.<br> Ninth Avenue and Tenth Avenue, which run the entire length of the neighborhood, are where most retail, dining, and nightlife is located. There are nearly 100 restaurants offering almost every type of cuisine, dozens of bars and pubs, and lots of boutiques. Eleventh Avenue still tends to be fairly industrial. And along the Hudson River you'll find New York's convention center, which takes up several blocks, and the Intrepid Sea Air & Space Museum, a tourist favorite featuring a decommissioned aircraft carrier, submarine, space shuttle, and jets.<br> The DeWitt Clinton Park covers two full blocks and includes a dog run, sports fields, and gardens. Hell's Kitchen park offers basketball and handball courts and a playground. Along the Hudson the Greenway offers a path to walk or bike all the way down to the southern or northern tips of Manhattan.<br> Hell's Kitchen is bordered on the north by the Upper West Side, on the east by Midtown and the Garment District, on the south by Chelsea, and on the west by the Hudson River."

        "There is a variety of seasons in this area, when it's summer you know it and when it's winter you feel it also. The weather did not impact me dramatically. As long as I checked the weather before I left the house it was relatively good, rarely any surprising weather changes.",
        "The neighbors that I had while living their were very friendly. They opened up doors for me and if I needed help carrying luggage someone always offered a helping hand. Saying hello to a neighbor when you saw him/her was very normal.",
        "I am not inclined to really give a full opinion on this question because I did not apply for any jobs in the area. But based on observation the job outlook looked average. If you had experience and knew people in the area you were definitely favored more than ones who did not.",
        "Don't have much of an opinion",
        "No worries about natural disasters!",
        "There are a few job opportunities and most of them need you to speak Spanish. I don't speak Spanish.",
        "Things around here are adequate",
        "I really wouldn't know because I don't work here.",
        "Here public services are quick, fast and very convenient, fire departments are near by for any quick emergency, police cars and police trucks are always found around this area, ambulances and paramedics are just as much found here as fire trucks.",
        "Jobs around this area, are not as good when it comes to how much it would pay, but restaurants are in abundance over here and requires skilled people for cooking and not skilled for cleaning or other things, also many clubs around here need security guards, supermarkets need clerks, people for packing, so jobs such as chefs, maintenance and construction workers are top employers around here",
        "Very few Rain, not much of storms maybe once in a year, not affected by tornadoes, hurricane or earthquakes.",
        "It's okay as long as you aren't just used to one type of temperature. We experience all four seasons to their fullest extent.",
        "Employment is limited if you are just focusing on certain neighborhoods but the net is definitely widened if you are searching the city as a whole.",
        "Public transportation is a must for this urban area. The MTA is not always the best but compared to other areas it runs pretty consistently. Only gripe is constant fare hikes are not on level with the upgrades/maintenance.",

        "Can be challenging if not prepared",
        "A pool would be nice.",
        "Everybody seems to get along",
        "Quiet neighborhood in the residential areas.  Picks up in intensity and can be very busy in commercial area.",
        "Over the years, its improved very much. Its much safer and everything is very fixable without needing any police or firefighters involved. The police are visible and there when needed and so are the firefighters and hospitals in the area.",
        "The police are quick to response to any emergency.",
        "There isn't a local precinct in my community and it is worrisome when a crime occurs because the police are not prompt.",
        "I feel pretty safe about the area, i can go a whatever time without worry.",
        "Crimes have stayed the same. The police however should patrol more.",
        "we do not have much crime in my area so i would have to say that it is pretty safe",
        "During the winter and spring I think things are normal nothing out of the ordinary however, during the summer everyone is out in the streets, so you will most likely see fights, arguments, and other craziness.",
        "So far crimee doesn't concern me very much in my area. A lot of people around 24/7",
        "This is a very safe place to live.",
        "The crime and safety in the community is okay however its getting better with time.",
        "I felt safe in my area, but that doesn't mean their was absolutely no crime that happened while I lived there. I knew that the police were involved in the area but I never needed to call them, therefore I do not know how effective they are. But I did know of some minor crimes that took place but not major ones.",
        "Got robbed once but other than that, its been safe",
        "There are recurring burglaries. Some shady looking characters hanging around parks, streets, sometimes.",

        "There is crime, but there is a sense of safety in numbers and your neighborhood looking out for their own.",
        "Pot holes still not repaired from winter road salting, some buildings need outside flood lights",
        "Inwood is a very lively neighborhood mixed with a ton of different cultures. The community is very kind and there's always a local event whether it be for the kids or just the adults.",
        "I've lived in the neighborhood for over 8 years and have witnessed it go dramatically downhill in the last few years. It's very sad. Big drug problem, violence, lots of aggressive speeding and erratic driving, dirt bikes speeding on sidewalks and in Inwood Hill Park. I no longer recommend this neighborhood and we are moving to Brooklyn next year. I wish the local police would wake up.",
        "So great honestly best place ever I love it a lot like you should move here if you don’t live here periodttttt",
        "Horrible. Schools are terrible. The neighborhood is dangerous. I don’t feel safe here or raising my child here. Rent is extremely high. Very overrated. I’ve lived here 10 yrs and conditions are just getting worse. Drug dealers outside of every building. Strong marijuana smell.",
        "Inwood is a great neighborhood with great bars and nice restaurants while also being a quick express A train to the city. The 1 train is also right there. There are great food carts with empanadas and smoothie places if you want to go for something healthier!",
        "Beautiful scenery and amazing restaurants. The entire neighborhood is full of culture and diversity. You can never find yourself bored or without something to do. Taking walks around Inwood Hill Park with friends and family or visiting The Cloisters in the summer and spring is a breathtaking sight.",
        "It’s actually a pretty good neighborhood, it has a couple parks where you could sit and relax and just watch people pass by or go for a quick jog or even walk you dog. It’s pretty dense with Hispanic culture but that’s what keeps this area lively. The further up you go passed 215 till you hit the bridge the less interesting and dull it gets since there’s not much going on over there I wish I get to see that area get more businesses that people would enjoy and hold events to get that area more recognition.",
        "I have never liked growing up here, in Inwood. It was always too loud, too many cars beeping at each other relentlessly. It was not a place I would have loved to call home. But over the years I realized that my neighborhood is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in the states, it makes me, a person of color, feel safe. Feeling safe is what home is all about.",
        "What I liked the most about living in Inwood is the convenience of having stores nearby.  Inwood is also a quiet neighborhood away from the college scene.",
        "I moved to the Inwood neighborhood about 10 years ago when I was 13 years old. It is a very populated neighborhood. There are many restaurants, bars, and clubs all through out the area, especially Latin/Dominican food, such as Inwood Local, Mamajuana, Mama Sushi. Since there are an abundant amount of bars, the neighborhood can at times tend to get noisy. The neighborhood has a great park to go running or to just meditate, it is called Inwood Hill Park. Nearby are many forms of public transportation like the A and 1 train.",
        "I’ve lived on inwood for a few years now, I like the neighborhood, I honestly would like to see more kid friendly business, more activity for kids, where parent can take a Sunday afternoon to do activities sound the neighborhood with them!",
        "I have been living  in the inwood area of Manhattan for a few years. The neighborhood is overall very friendly and family orientated. The area is changing and becoming modern, the apartments are very large. I feel living in Inwood, you can get more for your buck than in some other areas of Manhattan.  Living in this area I don't see much of violence or police activity, or gang activities which is a blessing considering I am raising two daughters in this neighborhood.",
        "I love the cultural aspect of Inwood. There are many things to do from trying out great restaurants to taking a nice stroll in Inwood Hill Park.",
        "Inwood is a very interesting place to live. It’s like a combination of Bronx and Manahattan, with makes it a good place for those who prefer one or the other.\n\nThe subway is close, specifically likes A and 1 run around this area, and some buses like the Bx7 and more.\n\nThere’s plenty of options when it comes to food, catering to different tastes.\n\nSome parts are quiet, others are loud. Parking is very limited.\n\nThings that I would like to see improve are: avalibility of more parking spots, and the reduction of night life activities around residences.",
        "People are very welcoming and very cultured. Inwood is very diverse and I love being able to walk outside and be able to go anywhere in the city.",
        "I have lived in inwood all my life. It is a great location its on the cusp of a very lively neighborhood as well as a relaxed and quiet neighborhood. There is great food and nice family spots and parks near by. The only downside is the distance to downtown but that is made up with the express A train, it really doesn't feel long at all.",
        "I love that the area is very safe. There are lots of shops, restaurants and bars. There is also a fish market and many take out food. There are 2 parks around the area as well as the cloisters.",
        "I love my neighborhood because its kind of like the suburbs of the city. Its quite and great access to nature. what i would love more of is gyms other than planet fitness and more healthy options for eating out.",
        "Living in Inwood has been a very exciting and thrilling experience. With everything being in walking distance, there is almost no way you could miss out on any fun. Whether its going hiking in Inwood Park or dancing the night away in some of their famous lounges, there is always something to do here. Not to mention that if anything \"crazy\" were to happen to you, the hospital is also right there! Inwood is filled with a lot of diversity; you can always get a taste of different cultures just by taking a walk through Broadway. The only down side to living here was finding parking. But that's only if you don't mind paying for the public garages.",
        "I have actually been living pretty good in Inwood. Which is located in Uptown, Manhattan, NY. It's a calm and serene neighborhood most of the time. When something do happen, I see the police officers minutes after. The neighborhood it's 90% clean, and most try to keep it that way.",
        "Could be better. Rents are too high.",
        "The housing in the area was pretty good depending on if you are comfortable with apartment sized living spaces. I did not see any abandoned properties. The cost of living is about 3-4000 dollars per month and the best place in my opinion to reside is Inwood.",
        "It is a condensed urban area so there are lots of apartment buildings and it is hugely populated. The area is being advertised more so there is a new influx of people moving into the area.",
        "Mostly co-ops and very affordable compared to the rest of Manhattan.",
        "The food near this area was very good and based on the amount of people who went out at night so were the drinks.",
        "The area that I lived in was very convenient and affordable, their were coffee shops, restaurants, laundry mats, shops, and many more. I typically favored the coffee shops because they were very unique and comfortable. The laundry mats were convenient and almost always available when I needed  them and the customer service was polite and welcoming. The shops were average, not my favorite but matched the uniqueness of the area!",
        "Really great parks but accessibility but hiking trails aren't maintained",
        "Lot of restaurants and a few clubs. It just seems like its all aimed to please only one ethnicity.",
        "Few good restaurants. Lots of supermarkets and pharmacies. No home improvement stores. No mall. No movie theater/cinema.",
        "There are a few parks here which is rare in NYC, so I like that.",
        "I hardly visit the restaurants as I stated in last page, I'm not into drinking and partying. Food quality in most of these establishments are a second thought to drinks and entertainment.",
        "Inwood is a changing neighborhood. The supermarkets are limited. The big draw in the last few years is the restaurants that are basically a night scene for younger people. They call my adjacent block Alcohol Alley, and I've seen it on the news twice for a problematic situation to living conditions. Noise, general partying disturbances to neighbors. There are many rats, mice and roaches. The other stores are just so-so. You can survive here by getting basics within walking distances.",
        "Restaurants such as La Tina, Floridita, La nueva Espana, are great restaurant that offer tropical drinks/ Hispanic food.",
        "Most stores are very close and its easy to get there by walking. Stores such as Jimmy Jazz, Jeans Bar, Footlocker are very easily found and close to this area. These stores are some of the popular ones among sneakers and clothes, other stores such as Game stop and Best Buy are good stores as well",
        "There is a great variety of stores and because it is an urban area they are usually open late or at least for a certain time on a daily basis. Big emphasis on convenience of being able to find whatever you are looking for whether clothing, food or other goods.",
        "There are sufficient enough parks/recreation locations where one can go about enjoying nature.",
        "The neighborhood has improved to where people come into the neighborhood for the events, food and the nightlife as well. There is a great variety of things to try.",
        "alot of mom and pop shops. many delis and salon.",
        "Ft. Tryon Park has many activities",
        "No movie theater in the area.  In the past there were two.",
        "Nightlife, bar life has significantly increased",
        "i am a great fan of ray's in inwood but depending on what you want done with it you may want more of a stylist thing",
        "25 % post tax -- so about half of a paycheck a month -- in greenwich village but this has only been in the last couple of years for the first 6 years i lived here in harlem and inwood i spent basically one paycheck a month on rent. so your experience seems normal the only reason mine went from 50 % to 25 % was because 1. i started a new career and ended up making basically 40 % more than i was before and 2. i moved in with partner who pays more rent than i do",

        "never been easier to jaywalk i'm up in inwood and it seems like people have finally gotten some sense when i go out for groceries it feels like a sunday at 6am",
        "depending on how this virus acts and how long it stays most of the city might do back to how it was seriously though it ’ s such a complex question most of the places in queens felt like it was growing slower but it ’ s all still changing the paradox is that there are unchanged neighborhoods you ’ d never know because they hardly show up in tourism inwood or elmhurst and there ’ s really gentrified neighborhoods that look almost exactly the same crown heights east village but are all changed inside",
        "definitely challenging to find it lately where you find it really depends on neighborhood a friend in inwood said she's been finding it at her local c-town grocery store i'm in brooklyn and duane reade/walgreens get cleaned out of it quickly - i have n't seen any there in weeks some of our grocery stores also run out of it fast i found some in a smaller healthfood store/grocery store - some of the smaller pharmacies and bodegas have had it too if you're looking for a really specific kind/brand it's tougher but if you're willing to get what's there it's a lot easier",

        "my first suggestion would be to search for apartments based on whatever subway lines is closest to your school e.g anything that is nearby the subway stops along the the a b c d and 1 subway lines you can check on the mta's map here for what the closest stops are that way you wo n't have to worry about transferring from one train to another which is common for many on commuting to work myself included & nbsp ; ahead of all that you will definitely need to learn how to navigate the subway at some point in time there's no easy 1-2-3 guide for this and a youtube is probably faster but going by looking at the mta subway map plus the key shown there on the top-right corner plus when in doubt always ask a friendly face e.g an officer security any mta workers you come across booth agents anyone who is n't in a rush better to ask then to get lost below are my top few points when going anywhere by train at least & nbsp ; * technically every stop black and white dots is a **local stop** where all **local trains** stop at * white dots though mean that that stop is also an **express stop** these are the only stops **express trains** go to within that borough * and for both points above : these are not always true though on the weekends and/or due to never-ending construction so always check google maps the mta app and any other train-apps you use for help on how to navigate from one stop to another & nbsp ; for example take the 1/2/3 train lines these are the lines marked as red in the map notice how the 1 train is listed on every stop on the red line you can consider that the *local train* and look again to the white dots along the red lines see how they're marked as 2 or 3 this means the 2 and 3 are the *express trains* at least in manhattan once you go to another borough though like brooklyn at that point the trains can differ from being `` express'' in manhattan to `` local'' in brooklyn so again take a good look at the maps for where you need to go identify the trains you need and more importantly if lost ask someone & nbsp ; as for neighborhoods to look in i'd check anywhere within inwood washington heights upper west side uws and west of harlem anything nearby columbia university as starting points for your search if you're looking to stay along the 1 train",
        "yeah at least one of you should be there in person holding copies of everyone ’ s documents since places get snapped up within hours of going on the market just so you know the guarantor is often required to make 80-100x the rent of the entire apartment not just what your friend would pay for their room i think you should look in new jersey or perhaps upper manhattan neighborhoods like inwood on that budget a sort of average 2 bedroom would be $ 3,000 not in the poshest neighborhoods but not the worst or least convenient either not likely to have amenities like a dishwasher or elevator good luck",

Closer to the park you'll find stately brick apartment buildings, but as you move away the scenery becomes a lot more industrial.<br> Inwood is bordered on the north and east by the Harlem River, on the south by Fort George, and on the west by the Hudson River.",

And yet, Inwood is still very much a classic Upper Manhattan neighborhood with a small-town feel.   Along Dyckman, you'll find plenty of mom and pop eateries side-by-side with unpretentious wine bars and restaurants.  While it is far from the heart of Midtown, residents enjoy relatively short commutes to Midtown via the A train or the 1 train.  The area offers a mix of single-family homes, co-ops and rentals in large apartment buildings.  Across the board, Inwood has some of the most affordable housing costs in the city. ",

Most people move to Inwood for the affordable cost of living, but find themselves staying for the high quality of life and sense of open space. The pace of life in Inwood changes from block to block.  Busy commercial avenues give way to familiar residential streets.

studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you ’ d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you ’ d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you ’ d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have",

Since then, many of the area's Italian-American residents have relocated to other Italian enclaves like East Harlem, the Bronx, and Staten Island. Still, their original legacy remains, and is woven into the fabric of this culturally distinct pocket of lower Manhattan.",

As gentrification pushes out long time tenants and Chinatown encroaches on Little Italy's historic boundaries, there's not much Italian left in this lower Manhattan neighborhood. Once covering fifty square blocks, it's now down to a fraction of that. But the annual Feast of San Gennaro parade still attracts a large number of Italian-Americans from around the city.<br> The main drag, Mulberry Street, features a number of good (and not-so-good) Italian restaurants that mostly bring in tourists looking for an authentic experience. (Insider's tip: there's much better Italian food elsewhere in this city). On the other blocks you'll find quieter, tree-lined streets of brick apartment buildings, historic churches, small museums, and the spectacular edifice that once headquartered the New York Police and has since been converted into luxury condos (its domed penthouse was listed for USD $40M).<br> The great thing about Little Italy is its location: it's right in the middle of a collection of fantastic neighborhoods, all within easy walking distance.<br> Little Italy is bordered on the north by Nolita, on the east by the Bowery, on the south by Chinatown, and on the west by SoHo."

Since the start of the summer there have been several murders, rapes, robberies, and gang violence. I avoid walking outside alone during the night, I avoid certain areas, and if for whatever reason I have to be outside at night, I am always talking to someone on the phone and updating them about my whereabouts. At night the police tend to stay in one area. I don't feel like the police would get to me in time in the event of an emergency because many of the buildings in my neighborhood look the same, and the police tend to get lost. For instance, a few years ago I called 911 because my infant niece was choking. The police and ambulance arrived 20-25 min later and told us they got lost. Unfortunately, since then I don't trust that they will get to me or anyone else in time.",

The structures here aren’t great and living conditions in certain places are below average, much of the people are low income. All in all, as long as you stay on the busy side of the street than you should be safe.",

The 1,2,3 and A,C,E at fulton; the 4,5,6 and the J/Z at Brooklyn Bridge; the R at Rector street, and the PATH train at the World Trade Center.

There are a lot of parks, gardens, restaurants, and many other activities to take part in. There are trains and busses around nearly every corner so if you don’t have a car it is easy to get to where you want to go. Depending on what part of the LES you are in, you have easy access to China Town, Little Italy, Soho, Greenwhich Village, and many other fun and interesting places. There is so much to do it is hard not to love it. \n\nLike many places, the LES is facing gentrification. I would change that soon some of the people who have been here all their life will no longer be able to afford to live in their homes. I would also try to change the number of bars and alcohol stores there are especially around schools.",

For instance, there are many areas in my apartment that need plastering, However, when you call to make a ticket for plastering they tell you they won't be viable to do so for months. I have had the same kitchen cabinets in my apartment for over 30 years, and they will not replace it because they claim there aren't any new cabinets available. cost of housing is cheap because  rent is dependent on your income. In this particular housing project, we do not have to pay for electricity or water. We do however have to pay for each air conditioner in the household. All housing projects are the worst areas to reside in, they are polluted with poverty and drugs and thus crime. I would say that the projects that I live in are much safer than the neighboring projects. And if I had to choose between any projects in lower Manhattan, I would choose mine.",

On a weekend night its streets teem with people in their 20s and 30s from all parts of the city.<br> Complementing the busy nightlife, there is a lot happening during the day as well. The LES has hundreds of restaurants and cafes, dozens of clothing stores, and over 100 art galleries.<br> Countering the buzz of the neighborhood's core, you can find quieter spots closer to the river.<br> The population is a mix of old and new. Long-time Chinese, Latino, and Jewish residents now share the space with young professionals and families. The old tenements are now walk-up apartments. The influx of new residents with money has also brought in development of shiny new condos, including the well-known \"Blue Condo\" building and 100 Norfolk developments.<br> The Lower East Side is bordered on the north by the East Village, on the east by the East River, on the south by Two Bridges, and on the west by Chinatown and Bowery.",
        "The Lower East Side is an authentic New York City neighborhood in the realest sense.  There is nothing polished or polite about it and its chaotic energy appeals to anyone who thrives on late nights and a live-and-let-live lifestyle. ",
        "The narrow streets of the Lower East Side were once lined with tenement buildings, shirt factories and bialy shops.  Although a few vestiges of the neighborhood's immigrant heritage remain, many of the tenement buildings have been updated and now offer relatively affordable rental options to young New Yorkers looking to live right in the thick of Downtown Manhattan.  There's no getting around it - the LES is a major nightlife destination.  In this part of the city, last call is late and often negotiable -- especially if you're a regular.  On weekend nights, the neighborhood is packed as crowds overflow from the local bars and take to the streets in search of a late-night falafel fix before heading onto the next party.  During the day, the neighborhood chills out as residents nurse their hangovers or head to work slowly after stopping at one of the area's many trendy juice bars or coffee shops. ",

        "The Lower East Side is truly a 24/7 kind of place.  Whether you're looking for a last-minute concert, a nightcap or a slice of pizza for breakfast - the LES has you covered. ",
        "The Lower East Side is not a place to go for beautiful tree-lined blocks as the area severely lacks in green space. ",
        "Housing stock in the LES is primarily comprised of tenement-style apartment buildings.  As such, the properties tend to be walk-ups with unique, if outdated, layouts.  Prices for these types of units were once on par with their quality, but the neighborhood has grown increasingly expensive. ",
        "Although artsy pop-up shops and galleries now fill the storefronts, the LES was once predominantly a neighborhood of immigrants with many businesses catering to Jewish and Puerto Rican residents. The Lower East Side has a street style all its own, embracing anything bold, original and unorthodox. For those looking for a conventional neighborhood, the LES is not it.  It's gritty and dirty with a rough-around-the-edges beauty to its rusting fire escapes and pulsing street life. The LES is full of surprises and incongruities.  Trendy sandwich shops stand next to traditional cobblers and hosieries and there are several historic shops still open on Orchard Street. Although it's always a busy neighborhood, the LES really comes to life after the sun goes down when young people pour in from all over the city. "

        "Overall the houses are pretty well kept due to the home owners. They paint their gates every now and then. There is one abandoned house that has not been touched for about 3 years. The family that used to live there left a while ago, but I don't know if anyone owns it now. I know that the houses closer to Adrian Avenue seem to have a backyard and so do the ones on Terrace view, however the Houses on Marble Hill have garages at least for the most part.

        "If I could rate Manhattan as a whole, I would and at 5 stars. However, this is asking about my specific 'hood, which is Midtown South, and I cannot rate it 5 stars for several reasons. Being located near the Empire State Building, it is a fight to get home walking along 34th Street (any adjacent street, too) is nearly impossible. Often times I find myself walking in the street. The housing availability is also abysmal. I do not often see rentals available because the neighborhood is more business-oriented. On the plus side, commuting is easy because it is a stone's throw from nearly all the main subway lines. You have several restaurants around. Shopping is made easy because you are near several shops on 34th. \n\nWhile it's a nice place to live if you are commuter heavy, if given another choice I'd move.",

There are many train options around which is handy in case one of the lines is having issues. Most importantly, there are many great food options in the area. Always a plus. :) One thing I wish would be different is the noise of 8th avenue traffic. The sirens can get to be a bit much when there's a traffic jam.",

I love the area, I really do - there's shopping, good food available, and the park is right across the street. great for families with kids and pets, but also perfectly suitable for a lone wolf. I'd say the only drawback is the increasing homeless problem...we have our \"regular\" homeless, but they've gotten rowdier in recent months. Also, the pedicab drivers and bike rental salespeople are the most annoying, invasive people on the planet - and they're EVERYWHERE. on every corner, begging you to come with them and take a pedicab ride or rent a bike. That leads to another big drawback - the tourists. They, too, are everywhere. I hate tourists,so it definitely gets to me. I try to hang around outside towards the evening, when most tourists and pop-up salesmen are gone, and it's emptier, quieter, and an overall much nicer area. At the end of the day though, these are very minor things in the scheme of it all. It's really a wonderful area, and I think I'd still live here if I could do it all over again - it's just so accessible and so full of life and rich with culture - it is very, very New York, in the best way possible.",
        "It's very vibrant if you've never been to new york before. The people here are very helpful when it comes to looking for directions or good places to eat more or less. The atmosphere that new york city creates is so beautiful it doesn't make you not want to do anything! Once i do move from new york city i think it would be a place i would come back to because new york just has a piece of me that no one else really has.",

There plenty of clothing stores for men, women, and children, catering to all types of styles. Besides the Korean restaurants and a few delis which are locally owned, all other food and retail establishments are corporations and franchises.",

        "> opinion : because the market moves fast regardless of time of year a listing that has been up online for long probably means there's something wrong and anyone who viewed it found something that convinced them not to sign top floor walk up noisy neighbors did not look like photos as advertised it could also mean nothing at all best to check out for yourself not always the case sometimes listings are just over priced and there are better deals out there even the crappiest of apartments will rent quickly if it's a good value relative to other options > according to a couple brokers i spoke to - not all landlords require 40x rule and it will depend on their preference and neighborhood i think the higher end the neighborhood the more likely they will require this yes and no it has to do with who is managing the apartment if the apartment is managed by a management company almost always 40x i know landlords who only require 35x and some who require as much as 50 or 60 for couples ones who do n't care tend to be in less popular areas of the city further out from midtown managed by small owners and not management companies",

if you're getting sloppy then it's time to go home if you become a regular in the `` scene'' and people see that you're still keeping it classy at the end of the party they're very apt to invite you to an afterparty - which in most cases ends up being even more awesome than the party itself was * there are a couple after-hours clubs in bushwick that i know of - they advertise more than they used to but i'll leave you to find them for yourself they typically open around 4am and go until noon or 2pm the crowd tends to be fueled by stimulants and eagerly and openly consuming more and be a bit older and more mature and have a bit higher of an income since they can afford the second admission price + `` fuel'' some `` afters'' have really cool vibes and some feel like crack dens looking at you bushwick a/v you got ta find the right ones to go to and usually the newer ones are better admission is usually about $ 40 most serve booze the entire time but the crap ones bushwick a/v do n't serve until like 10am drinks are mad expensive basically go to afters if you feel like you have at least another 2 hours of party left in you some are kinda down-tempo and ketamine-y and some are banging house and techno and coke-y my favorite is that raging 5am melodic tech-house taking me to new heights while the sun rises < 3 * dance however makes you feel happy nobody cares how ridiculous you might look - it's all about free expression move your body to the beat however feels right to you try out different moves move your feet ugh people you have to move your feet to dance shuffling looks cool - check out some youtube videos * always have your drink in your hand or in front of you and even better if you cover it with a small napkin and be careful what drink you take - swim once inadvertently dosed himself by drinking from the wrong water bottle * i love going out alone i go where i want when i want a big plus is not having to babysit anyone i do n't have to hang around an event i do n't want to be at because other people want to stay or have to leave because other people want to go and if i get invited someplace afterward it's usually a lot better if i'm one or two people than 3+ * most of the people who really participate in the `` scene'' are super friendly and love to meet cool new people and welcome them into the fold it may seem like everyone knows everyone or it's one degree of separation but for the most part it is very welcoming and not exclusive and `` judgy'' * do n't let one or two bad experiences ruin your curiosity for raving there are a lot of parties in nyc and most of them are `` meh'' at best some are really super friggin awesome check resident advisor * someone mentioned kostume kult's valentines lunar new year party being on feb. 14th i'm producing the event and while it's going to be uh-may-zing it is meant to be a bit more low-key than the 3 big parties we throw each year - it's in a swanky new big midtown bar and the sound system although good quality will be tiny in comparison to a proper rave since it has to be in a space with low ceilings our parties are based around costuming and theatrics - we do a lot of cool quirky and interactive things and have some really cool artists and art pieces on display check out our black & light ball horned ball or `` freakk show'' parties in the next few months * for many of us nightlife is an opportunity to do and be the things that our jobs and society tell us are unfashionable or taboo during normal waking hours and it is an outlet for creative expression some of us like to dress up in interesting or elaborate outfits or costumes in funky prints and styles or craft our own costume pieces just for fun some of us like to bend the norms of what clothing each gender is `` supposed'' to wear because they ca n't do it at work or around most of their friends but it is still a significant part of their self-identity ... and it feels really great to confidently express oneself * meeting new people is easy but do n't be creepy i was very introverted when first entering nightlife and over the years have learned some handy tricks to break the ice with strangers simply ask if they know which dj is playing if they do ask what time they play until and who comes on next ask if they've been to the venue before - then ask if they have these sortsa parties there often this opens up so many opportunities for conversation if you smoke invite them out for a smoke most people are friendly and cool * a really really great party can be a magical experience an overwhelming feeling of happiness and completeness full of good vibes and good energy and wow i've only been to a couple such parties over the years but they are so memorable and i want that experience again * parties usually start around 10pm-11pm people do n't really start arriving until 60-90 minutes after doors open people who are just drinking or sober usually go home around 3am-4am when the bar closes after 5am 5:30 6am that is when the party really gets going super high energy really great vibes really great music and oftentimes really unique venues i've felt like i've landed in a hollywood movie a couple times - i never imagined seeing that side of new york city : -o * tip for stashing pills and'cid : tape to the underside of your weewee so it rests on your sack take it out soonish after getting through security so it does n't get wet with sweat * be discrete with your chemicals do n't be fking obvious and especially at legal venues most will throw you right out if you're busted being in the middle of a crowded dancefloor helps safest bet : quickly in the loo akumandra is going to be beyond amazing next saturday 2/15 < 3 have fun be safe be responsible",

which is an exercise in futility as i ’ m about to extinguish any shred of modesty by vehemently stating something that might piss you off i ’ m most likely smarter than you this is not some self-proclaimed title i ’ ve audaciously given myself like some pompous asshole while somewhat egocentric allow me to explain here is where i redeem myself i think i ’ m stupid as hell as a matter fact i know i ’ m stupid as hell i once ordered a three-piece lamp from amazon that was so easy & effortless to assemble it didn ’ t even include an instructional manual more like a cooking recipe on the back of a 2 ” by 6 ” lamented card that which ironically i found to be that silver lining for it provided solace and smelled of “ new car scent ; ” the kind of scent that makes you nostalgic yet optimistically reminiscing the past in hindsight to create a fantasy of a hypothetical future scenario i digress after 88 minutes of frustration i broke the lamp forcing the pieces together in an almost primitive manner for i could not let the lamp best me : then my brother whose 5 years younger so 23 walks in which just adds more stress and frustration as he repeats “ let me do it ” like a goddamn parrot 🦜 incessantly a bit of crazy glue on the broken piece and i was right back at square one with the three assembled pieces or rather unassembled pieces when i finally conceded and handed it to my younger brother who proceeded to emasculate me in the most humiliating manner by literally assembling it within 15 seconds and not even looking at the bullshit postcard “ instructions. ” my point i think outside the box i don ’ t think i ’ m smart i just think i ’ m different and i know everybody wants to be different but believe me all i want is to be normal i ’ m pretty phenomenal at sociology behavioral science & cognitive ability also critical thinking and the defect would be my mind fires and 12 directions at once even now as i ’ m writing this i ’ m multitasking two other things while thinking of 8. took the official stanford-binet iq test proctored for lulz i scored 146 supposedly the 98th percentile at which point i will now proceed to revert back to the narcissistic pathetic over-compensating loser by stating that i was pissed i found it absolutely irresponsible & irredeemable on my part that 2 % of human beings on this planet scored higher than me that ’ s roughly 160 million people i refuse to accept that there are 160 million apes on this planet who have better cognitive behavior analysis memory & photogenic memory to the capacity as the tldr self-loathing douche yours truly whose writing this so enough rambling here is my proposal i work a lot i don ’ t have many friends probably because i set the bar pretty high because i am untenable i ’ m stubborn to a fault and egregiously fatalistic however if you ’ re a hidden gem 💎 someone who is able to reciprocate and complement my characteristics and personality traits both defects faults and strengths in a way that it simply is easy ... we just click together like the aforementioned lamp that my codependent incompetency revealed i ’ m incapable of doing i can however build a door processor gpu in under 20 minutes with all components nuts bolts and tools included so don ’ t ask me how that is possible i can only surmise that the lamp was simply too easy to assemble that i couldn ’ t do it again another narcissistic thing to say but let me get to my proposal i tried dating apps and they ’ re awkward as hell definitely not for me after six months of hating myself for being inadequate so much so i worshipped the ground walked on by a woman i ’ ve devoted my best years to & purchased an $ 18,000 beyoncé like engagement ring 💍 that would in short define who i am : a hopeless romantic whose into grand gestures & somewhat old fashioned ... i suppose so initially i was going to go with some random girl i met on insert dating app by politically correct liberal where you objectify women by “ swiping ” left or right ;

studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you ’ d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you ’ d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you ’ d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have",

Home to iconic skyscrapers like the Chrysler Building, Rockefeller Center, and United Nations Headquarters, this timeless, architecturally important neighborhood is at the heart of it all, while its serene, tree-lined cross streets house some of Manhattan’s most prestigious and sought-after residential buildings.",
        "A convenient neighborhood in the center of Manhattan that provides A-list cultural attractions and easy access to anywhere in the city.",
        "From the world-renowned shopping of Fifth Avenue to people-watching at Rockefeller Center, Midtown East is filled to the brim with picture-postcard New York City moments.",
        "Vibrant and bustling, with all the best of Manhattan living mere steps from your front door.",
        "There’s always something happening here. Bryant Park is a popular hub in Midtown no matter the time of year. During the summer, people gather for yoga classes, outdoor movie screenings, and picnics. Come winter, neighbors spend afternoons ice skating here. It's perhaps most used during the day as a great way for those that work in the area to take a much needed break from the work day.",
        "The non-stop party atmosphere of  trendy Downtown neighborhoods.",
        "Midtown East isn’t trying to compete with the Lower East Side or Brooklyn to be the coolest kid on the block. The scene here is a bit more refined; with the Museum of Modern Art, the Morgan Library, and the main branch of the New York Public Library, you’ll never be at a loss for top-tier cultural attractions. Michelin-starred eateries like Daniel and The Modern are plentiful.",

        "With an array of of stately prewar towers and sleek  full-service high-rises, there are lots of options in Midtown East, particularly at the higher end of the market. Classic townhouses provide even more options for spacious luxury homes. Beyond the luxury condo and coop buildings, renters will find plenty of options, particularly in the Turtle Bay section east of Lexington Avenue.",
        "The city skyline and waterfront vistas, best seen from above.",
        "While Midtown East is best known for being in the center of everything, for many residents the prime appeal is the tranquil setting along the East River. Many high-rise towers offer views stretching out over the river to Queens, up to the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge, and across the skyline of Midtown Manhattan. A popular amenity in the neighborhood is a rooftop deck offering sweeping views.",
        "Midtown is New York in a nutshell: theaters, shopping, business, and great parks.",
        "Midtown is a commercial and residential neighborhood that sits, as the name implies, more or less in the middle of Manhattan island. Many major companies have their headquarters here, including CBS, Ernst & Young, Bloomberg L.P., Morgan Stanley, Time Warner, and Viacom.<br> It's also a shopping mecca: Fifth Avenue is lined with flagship stores for many of the world's luxury brands, several department stores, and many popular chains. 57th Street is among the most expensive commercial real estate in the world. And due to its proximity to the United Nations Headquarters more than a dozen countries have consulates located here. Midtown also includes Times Square and the Theater District, two hubs of tourist activity. Hopefully you're getting the picture that this is not a mellow neighborhood.<br> But for people who want to walk out of their homes into this energy, it's a great place to live. There are a number of luxury high rises offering hotel-style amenities, ranging from gyms to childcare, making it a popular place for families who work in the area and can afford it.<br> When you do want to get away from the hustle or bustle, or just get some exercise, you can head to the famous Central Park for a run or to lounge on its grassy fields.<br> Midtown is bordered on the north by Central Park, on the east by Turtle Bay, on the south by the Garment District and Koreatown, and on the west by Hell's Kitchen.",
        "Midtown is the tall, busy, beating heart of Manhattan.  During the day, its sidewalks and subway stations bustle with office workers and tourists.  At night, Times Square, the Theater District, and the restaurant and nightlife hubs here thrum with energy, while other areas empty out. ",
        "If you're looking for a neighborhood with tree-lined streets and quaint coffee shops, Midtown isn't it.  The neighborhood is more of a center for business than a residential community, but it puts everything close at hand for those who dwell here.  Skyscrapers rise above congested streets, tourists flock to Broadway shows and Times Square, and thousands of commuters pass through Grand Central Terminal, Pennsylvania Station, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal every day.  The real estate options in Midtown can be diverse; surprisingly affordable apartments can be found alongside some of the city’s most expensive properties.  The headquarters of many global corporations line Sixth Avenue, while Fifth Avenue is an upscale retail destination with stores from some of the world's best-known brands. ",
        "Midtown is truly in the thick of it all.  Everyone has somewhere to go, and there's not much interest in slowing down.  That's what happens when a neighborhood is a global center of business, media, and entertainment. ",
        "Grand Central Terminal is an essential transportation hub and a surprisingly diverse shopping center.  Its grand architecture and starry mural help quell the commuter chaos. ",
        "The iconic statue outside Rockefeller Center is actually a misrepresentation.  According to Greek myth, Atlas held up the heavens, not the Earth!",
        "Midtown offers direct access to a huge shopping district, world-class museums, and dozens of theaters and entertainment venues.  If you want it, it's here. ",
        "All of the excitement comes with traffic, crowds, and noise — and since this is New York, they happen 24 hours a day. ",
        "Although there are some affordable older buildings, Midtown is famous for its luxury high-rises.  Prices at buildings like One57 and 432 Park Avenue start in the millions and go about as high as you can imagine. ",
        "Sidewalks lined with vendors, crowded streets and towering skyscrapers are staples of Midtown.  Thousands of commuters pass through Grand Central Terminal every day. Although parts of Midtown empty out at night as office workers head home, there is always activity in Times Square, and the neighborhood offers tons of nightlife options. Rockefeller Center is best known for its giant Christmas tree, but the place is packed year-round with tourists trying to catch a taping of 'Saturday Night Live' or the 'Today' show. Midtown is New York City's largest central business district, but now the neighborhood also boasts some of the city's most expensive real estate. Tourists flock to Midtown to see the Empire State Building, Grand Central, the grand stores on Fifth Avenue, and the southern end of Central Park. "

let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you ’ d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you ’ d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you ’ d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have",

        "Morningside Heights is an uptown Manhattan neighborhood whose real estate is largely taken up by higher education institutions: Columbia University, Barnard College, and the Manhattan School of Music. As you'd expect of a neighborhood surrounding several schools, this is a popular place to live for its student population. However, you'll also find long-established families living here thanks to housing that is more affordable than other parts of the city.<br> There are plenty of coffee shops and cheap eats catering to the student population. You'll also find a number of bars, but those are restricted to Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue so the side streets where most people live remain quiet.<br> On the west side of the neighborhood is the terrific Riverside Park, which runs the length of Manhattan island and provides 330 acres (135 hectares) of biking, walking, and running, a marina, dog runs, sports fields, playgrounds, a skate park, and the Boat Basin Café – a great place to have a beer at sunset. On the east side is the 30 acre Morningside Park, which sits along a cliff and features a baseball field, basketball courts, and a pond.<br> Morningside Heights is bordered on the north by Manhattanville and Harlem, on the east by Harlem, on the south by Upper West Side, and on the west by the Hudson River.",
        "Sandwiched between the northern tip of Central Park, 125th Street, and Riverside Park, is Morningside Heights, a neighborhood that blends a small-town feel with classic New York City sensibilities. ",
        "In many ways, Morningside Heights reminds of Park Slope or the nearby Upper West Side, especially in its ample green space, shady streets, and laid-back, homey feel.  What sets Morningside Heights apart, however, is the number of colleges and universities in and near the area. ",
        "Energetic and lively, Morningside Heights is defined by its many cultural and educational establishments including The Cathedral Church of St.  John the Divine and Columbia University. ",
        "",
        "Three peacocks: Jim, Harry, and Phil.  They live on the 13-acre grounds surrounding St.  John's. ",
        "From concerts at Miller Theatre to readings at Book Culture and roundtables at Union Theological Seminary, there's tons of stimulation for the mind here. ",
        "The area does not have an express subway stop. ",
        "Morningside Heights' housing stock is primarily located in large, prewar apartment buildings.  Co-ops along Riverside Drive can be large and quite expensive. ",
        "Morningside Heights has a wonderful street life.  Broadway is filled with local shops, and Riverside Park is often filled with joggers and cyclists. The neighborhood features a diversity of architecture.  Amid Morningside Heights' classic prewar apartment buildings are McKim, Mead and White's Columbia's campus and the neo-gothic stylings of Cathedral of Saint John the Divine. Morningside Heights has an authentic bohemian and literary spirit that can easily be found in its many cafes and bookshops. A true New York City neighborhood steeped in local culture and lore, Morningside Heights features the original facade of the famous Seinfeld diner. "

Many young professionals live in Murray Hill and residents tend to be liberal. The public schools in Murray Hill are above average.",

        "Roadwork and sidewalk maintenance is often left unfinished",
        "The only times when sirens run through the streets are when EMTs and fire trucks pass or when there is a car accident.",
        "It's a very certainly located neighborhood, you're close to midtown and downtown respectively. There's a vast variety of dining options as well as bar's, sometimes on the weekends the bar's can be annoying however. It can definitely be a friendly neighborhood with a \"small town\" feel to some extent, my local dry cleaner, deli, bar, restaurant and pharmacy all know me on a first name basis and generally know what I want without having to ask me. Love the neighborhood!",

        "I moved to Murray Hill after living in the East Village, a different neighborhood in downtown New York, for the past four years. Morning to Murray Hill was a little bit of a culture shock. I was very used to artsy vibe of East Village, constantly pulsating and always entertaining -  performers in Union Square and Tompkins Square Park, unique stores, vibrant nightlife, etc. It is also a very student-populated area due to the proximity to NYU. Murray Hill is very much a young professional's neighborhood, filled with 20-30 something year olds who moved here after college (such as myself). The neighborhood is filled with less quirky characters and a lot more happy hour specials. Though a tad more serious and toned down than the downtown neighborhoods, there is nevertheless a good selection of restaurants and bars, and not as quiet at night as areas like the Financial District or Upper East Side.",
        "Murray Hill neighborhood is filled with people from different cultures, businesses, and living complexes. There's always something to do or somewhere to go such as the grocery store, pizza store, newspaper stand, restaurants, clothing boutique, pharmacy, movie theater, and libraries. Murray Hill feels safe because there’s a sense of community, closure, and security. The mixture of locals, commuters, and tourists enhances the diversity in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is often quiet, but once it hits rush hour during the afternoon and at nighttime, that’s when the streets become the busiest. From all 5 boroughs, I’m glad I chose to live in such a welcoming place.",

mentioning a duane reade just opened three blocks from my apartment and they breathe a semi-sigh of relief — how did i get to harlem after i got accepted to grad school in nyc i made plans to live with one of my best friends from high school and college who was going to grad school at columbia i immediately booked a one-way ticket from tampa — my hometown — and told my roommate i trusted him completely to choose our new apartment i had no clue where i would be moving ; i was just so excited to make nyc my home my roommate sent me pictures of our future apartment and it was rental love at first sight i told him to sign on the spot the author on moving day after i told my uncle where my apartment was he has lived in nyc for over 30 years ; thus he acts just how you ’ d think he ripped me about 50 new assholes “ harlem are you crazy ” he asked “ do you know where that is do you know how dangerous it could be ” he wouldn ’ t stop making comparisons to my neighborhood and serpico and midnight cowboy and still hasn ’ t to this day the very next day he went to my neighborhood met my roommate for the first time and stood on my stoop for hours he walked around the neighborhood he talked to people on my block which i ’ m sincerely sad was not taped for my later entertainment he also walked around the neighborhood at night to give my father — his brother — a full report after he assured my dad the neighborhood wasn ’ t completely terrible but also pointing out the staircase in my building looked just like the one in a crack-den apartment in serpico he made me get mace which i still carry and named himself deputy commissioner of /u/i_keep_it_real_ ’ s security tepidly he gave three-fourths of his blessing i flew into jfk weeks later cabbed it to hamilton heights and promptly twirled about our beautiful big apartment carrie-style i went to explore the neighborhood which wasn ’ t scary to me at all it ’ s a mostly-dominican neighborhood complete with a mcdonalds

and cool in its own right i found my favorite places to eat and walk within time i ’ ve seen every ethnicity in my neighborhood : students families and everyone else – if i feel safe in harlem what is the lingering stigma about harlem that makes people scared for me first frankly it ’ s because i ’ m not a big black thug second there ’ s the crime history third i think harlem makes people think of a lone tumbleweed rolling down a deserted street landing at the door of a shady pawn shop do i feel safe i never haven ’ t here ’ s why : in new york everyone is crazy in some way — from larry david to michael bloomberg so if you go into any new york neighborhood under the assumption that everyone is crazy you will always have your guard up and your eyes forward do i get whistled at in the street “ ay mama ” sure but it ’ s no different than assholes in their first suits from barneys in financial district bars are thinking so it really doesn ’ t matter to me my roommate is muscular and black so when we walk down the street together people assume we ’ re just another hip racially mixed couple to not mess with we ’ re not he ’ s gay i like to pretend we ’ re lady gaga and usher taking a stroll just living our lives like my roommate and i harlem is eccentric it ’ s an urban norman rockwell painting tucked away next to the hudson river old men play chess on the sidewalks on overturned milk crates my dry cleaning guy waves at me every morning cheerfully sweeping his stoop in a wifebeater and tube socks as opposed to many other manhattan neighborhoods there are no women on macrobiotic diets dictating to nannies on the sidewalks on the contrary women in my neighborhood let their husbands have it in the middle of the street often wearing tropical-colored get-ups everyone is loony in their own charming way – there ’ s more to my neighborhood than its diversity from a girlish perspective my apartment features crown molding exposed brick and a washer/dryer in my bathroom from a real estate perspective the pre-war architecture of my neighborhood is incredible i don ’ t live in a shoebox and the rent is reasonable and from a thug perspective my address lends me a bit of street cred the cashier at my bodega says i keep it real jay-z and frank serpico have probably been here photo by author besides the duane reade alexander hamilton ’ s mansion is five minutes away the best pizza i ’ ve ever had — from a place that really does look like it was in serpico – is two blocks away and the biggest most authentic burritos i ’ ve ever had are across the street the west side highway jogging path and riverside park are a hop and a skip on hot days women sell shaved ice on the corner little kids play in the water of an open fire hydrant during summer a breathless homeless woman is always posted up at the liquor store 62 steps from my front stoop : “ canyouspareadollarcanyouspareadollar… ” – in some ways moving to harlem on a whim was like a drunken vegas wedding everyone thought would get annulled “ but i love it ” i wailed to my parents almost three years later harlem and i are still going strong it ’ s true — they say when you know you know carrie and samantha once had this exchange on sex and the city : carrie says “ i have to go to san francisco on a book tour. ” samantha replies “ you wouldn ’ t go to the upper west side suddenly you ’ re going to san francisco ” and ramona from real housewives made an inference that women brawl on the street 10 blocks north of me my reply : what the hell is wrong with the west side carrie and guess what the scariest thing is at the corner of 150th ramona a taco bell and a kfc yes i ’ m a girl who stereotypically doesn ’ t fit the bill to live here and i do love having girlish brunches downtown and am envious of people who live near gramercy park—but that doesn ’ t mean i can ’ t prevail in harlem nah mean /u/i_keep_it_real_ is an editorial assistant for advance publication ’ s reddit.com she does

        "Murray Hill is where college grads go to hang out with other college grads and party like they're still in college – picture lots of sports bars with cheap drink specials packed with people in their 20s on a Saturday night. Okay, okay, it's not exactly like that and there are certainly exceptions, but you get the idea.<br> Modern, high-rise condos tend to dominate the housing scene here, although there are brick walk-ups and on some of the quieter side streets you'll find single-family brownstones. Murray Hill is relatively more affordable than some of the surrounding neighborhoods in Manhattan (relative being the key term since everything in Manhattan is expensive).<br> There are a lot of nightlife options here catering to its young population. Most of the aforementioned sports bars are clustered around Third Avenue. You'll also find more low key pubs and a few lounges. Restaurant-wise there are plenty of affordable options and some higher end places. Murray Hill is known for its concentration of ethnic restaurants, including enough Indian eateries to earn the moniker 'Curry Hill'.<br> There are three stellar hospitals within the neighborhoods borders, several small parks, and a running path along the river. Since it's close to the United Nations headquarters you'll also find a mix of foreign consulates.<br> What Murray Hill perhaps lacks in charm, it makes up for with convenience – you can easily get to the business areas of Midtown or the Financial District or to some of the more interesting neighborhoods around for shopping and nightlife.<br> Murray Hill is bordered on the north by Midtown and Turtle Bay, on the east by the East River, on the south by Kips Bay and Rose Hill, and on the west by the Garment District.",

In the morning, the streets are filled with professionals looking polished in their Brooks Brothers suits as they head to work.  Come evening, you'll see the crowds returning home decked out in gym clothes and schlepping bags of take-out dinner and Trader Joe's.  The neighborhood has a down-to-earth, casual vibe, and there's always a big game airing at one of the many sports bars along the Third Avenue strip.  Many of Murray Hill's residents are renters who come and go, but the place eschews intransigence and maintains a familiar, college-town feel. ",

        "Businesses in Murray Hill offer daily happy hours, discounted laundry services, and 24-hour restaurants. Murray Hill is centrally located in between Midtown and Union Square.  Its proximity to Grand Central makes it perfect for reverse commuters. Murray Hill is somewhat homogenous in its residents.  If you're looking for an artistic and diverse neighborhood, this is not it. There are pockets of historic architecture, but most apartment buildings are either small walk-ups on the side streets or huge towers on the major cross streets. Like sports bars? Then you'll like Murray Hill.  Its residents work hard during the day, but come Thursday night, they like to let loose. "

let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you ’ d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you ’ d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you ’ d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have",

        "Noho, short for North of Houston, has a reputation of being one of the most in-demand neighborhoods in New York City. The area’s long-standing commercial history from 1850 to the early 1900’s helped shape the neighborhood’s striking architectural features, along with influential residents such as the Delanos and Peter Cooper. Formerly known as the “Warehouse District,” Noho’s vintage store-and-loft buildings have since been modernized to suit a more fashion-forward and edgy downtown styling.",
        "All of the benefits of living downtown, but also value a quick and easy commute to other parts of the city.",
        "Bounded by Broadway and Bowery, Noho maintains a six-block escape for those looking to get out of the crowds of nearby neighborhoods like Soho, Greenwich Village, or the East Village.",
        "Laid-back but constantly stimulating. Days are spent lounging at coffee shops or browsing boutiques, and nights are spent at sleek lounges and art house theaters.",
        "Noho’s entertainment and culture scene is heavily influenced by a history of having artists-in-residence. Colonnade Row is a perfect example of a residential-cultural space, with the Astor Place Theater serving as the original home of the acclaimed Blue Man Group and other off-Broadway shows.",
        "A quiet neighborhood with plenty of green space.",
        "There are almost no public parks and green spaces in this tiny, landlocked neighborhood. Those who want homes surrounded by nature might want to look elsewhere.",
        "Pricey. New luxury buildings near Bowery and walk-ups on side streets are some of the most highly sought-after in the downtown market.",
        "Noho has a relatively diverse mix of real-estate options, albeit in low quantities. Lofts and walk-ups lend themselves to a classic old-New York feel throughout the neighborhood.",
        "The unique architectural design and rich artistic history.",
        "Noho is known for its distinctive architectural style. Whether it’s Classical or Renaissance-inspired, Noho displays an eclectic mix of facades around every corner.",
        "Small in size but packed with things to see and do.",
        "NoHo continues New York's tradition of renaming newly hip neighborhoods after their relation to streets; in this case, it's a tiny neighborhood 'North of Houston Street'. Encompassing about ten small city blocks in lower Manhattan,  NoHo was once an industrial area but now is a highly desirable residential neighborhood. The beautiful buildings here show off about 200 years of different architecture, with modern residences going up next to renovated industrial lofts.<br> There is plenty of culture packed into this small area. The Angelika Film Center has been playing independent fare to cinephiles since 1989. Or you can catch off-Broadway shows at the historic Astor Theater, built in 1831, which was the original venue for the Blue Man Group's performances. Across the street, the Public Theater occupies the site of the former Astor Library, built in 1854. And the Bowery Poetry Club features readings, open mic nights, and poetry slams.<br> The neighborhood has plenty of great restaurants and bars as well and tends to be more subdued than the East Village crowd next door.<br> NoHo also features more unique shopping than its similarly geographic named sister to the south. The chain stores that have invaded SoHo aren't as prominent here, so you're more likely to stumble across one-of-a-kind boutiques.<br> NoHo attracts a diverse group of people, ranging from artists to Wall Street types. This is a great location for anyone working in Midtown or the Financial district since it sits in the middle of both and has a number of subway lines close by.<br> NoHo is bordered on the north by Gramercy Park, on the east by the East Village, on the south by Little Italy, and on the west by Greenwich Village."

Other celebs still cruise its streets and people watching here is a professional sport.<br> During the day, people frequent the low key restaurants and coffee shops on its tree-lined streets. This is also a trendy shopping district full of stylish boutiques, pop-ups, art galleries, and unique stores like the independent McNally Jackson bookstore. There is also plenty of nightlife, ranging from dive bars to upscale lounges, but this remains a quiet area thanks to its more mature population.<br> Despite the cool factor, this neighborhood has a friendly, cozy community vibe. It appeals to families, professionals, and singles alike. It's also the core of the Australian expat community in New York with several Australian-run businesses.<br> Nolita is bordered on the north by NoHo, on the east by Bowery, on the south by Little Italy, and on the west by SoHo."

        "Quiet and secluded, Roosevelt Island is perfect for families.",
        "Roosevelt Island is a quiet, relaxed, mostly-residential neighborhood on its own sliver of an island in New York's East River. It's a relatively easy commute into Midtown Manhattan (via bridge, subway, or aerial tram) or into Queens but other than for work, it's a self-sufficient 'hood with its own grocery stores, fitness centers, schools, restaurants, and recreation so you won't need to leave often. This is not the place to come for excitement, but if you're looking for a suburban vibe in the middle of New York City then this island fits the bill.<br> You'll find a mixed group of residents here across different incomes and age groups. While there is affordable housing here, more recently a number of luxury high rise apartments have been developed, affording stunning views of the city.<br> There are plenty of family-friendly amenities here, including athletic fields, playgrounds, picnic areas, and a community pool.<br> Cornell University and the Technion Institute of Technology have partnered on a USD $2 billion campus for computer science on the island.<br> Roosevelt Island is bordered on all sides by the East River.",
        "Connected to Manhattan by an iconic tram and one subway line, this narrow island is unlike any other neighborhood in the city.  Locals love Roosevelt Island’s quiet charm and quixotic character. ",
        "Roosevelt Island is an anomaly among New York City neighborhoods, and that's exactly its charm.  It's centrally located and isolated at the same time.  The buildings themselves are architecturally homogenous, but residents hail from all countries and backgrounds.  The island is just a stone's throw from the throngs of 57th Street but has just one commercial strip.  And though it has changed over time, it has always felt outside the orbit of normal city life.  Throughout the 19th century, the island was principally occupied by hospitals.  In the 1970s, it became a testing ground for new urban ideals and was redeveloped into a planned residential community, which explains those uniform brick high-rises and winding walkways.  Roosevelt Island's earliest residents were looking for a quiet, simple slice of life within city limits.  That appeal still holds today, even as new developments have risen and the Cornell Tech Campus looms over the southern part of the island. ",
        "Roosevelt Island has an undeniably sleepy, small-town vibe.  There's only a single road bridge, no traffic lights, and little parking.  The sounds of honking horns and sirens are rare. ",
        "While it's not at the center of things, Four Freedoms Park, which spans the southernmost tip of Roosevelt Island, is a popular destination for residents, students, and tourists. ",
        "Roosevelt Island has no shortage of quirks, but the ruins of the Smallpox Hospital are certainly unique.  The remnants of this 1850s building were featured in the climax of Spider-Man. ",
        "Roosevelt Island provides breathtaking vantages of the Midtown skyline and the East River — views unlike anything else in the city. ",
        "With just a handful of restaurants and stores, Roosevelt Island offers precious little in the way of commercial enticements or nightlife. ",
        "",
        "No more than 800 feet wide and less than two miles long, Roosevelt Island is ideal for walking.  Many pedestrian paths wind around the island. Spanning the southern tip of the island, Four Freedoms Park is a memorial to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the famous State of the Union address in which he championed universal human freedoms, including freedom of speech and worship, and freedom from want and fear. The Roosevelt Island Tramway runs back and forth from 59th Street and Second Avenue every seven to 15 minutes.  MetroCards accepted!The new Cornell Tech campus has brought a wave of students to the island and dramatically changed its architectural aesthetic. "

        "SoHo is a neighborhood in New York City, New York with a population of 11,268. SoHo is in New York County and is one of the best places to live in New York. Living in SoHo offers residents a dense urban feel and most residents rent their homes. In SoHo there are a lot of bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and parks. Many young professionals live in SoHo and residents tend to be liberal. The public schools in SoHo are above average.",

Home to one of the best universities, Soho is where one yearns to be educated. The area is filled with top notch eateries both affordable and trendy.  Iris the place for college students to spend time. You never tire of walking around, having a great meal, going shopping, studying and everything in between!",

        "Soho is a wonderful area, full of interesting people, lots of great stores, both \"ma and pa\" and corporate, fabulous cafes and restaurants, and fascinating historical sites, such as Aaron Burr's townhouse on Prince Street.  I have lived in Soho for several decades, and  I have witnessed the transformation from a middle class neighborhood to the hippest place in Manhattan, home to the  wealthy elite and celebrities.   Real estate and shopping prices have skyrocketed and many residents are not full time, but also have vacation homes elsewhere.  Still, Soho is a very relaxed and informal place, where people still hang out on the street and watch the world go by.",
        "Soho is one of the best neighborhoods in NYC.  It has access to all subway lines, but you need not travel above 23rd street to get what you need.

        "Simply amazing. If you're coming from out of state and want to see what New York is all about, SoHo is where to go!",
        "Atmosphere is very trendy but the downside is it does attract tourist and crowds.

        "advice are you moving this winter read this i know how difficult moving in the winter can be going out there when it's freezing cold to see apartments is no fun i work in real estate so i've used my experience plus the most recent advice posts on r/nycapartments to create this small q & a for people moving this winter : **first question most people ask -** where do i live which is the safest neighborhood where are the cheapest apartments - let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you ’ d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you ’ d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you ’ d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have",

        "SoHo refers to the historic neighborhood located 'South of Houston Street' in lower Manhattan (for you newbies, it's pronounced \"How-ston\", not \"Hew-ston\"). Along its cobblestone streets, the cast-iron buildings with large windows once provided space to garment manufacturers, then became cheap artists' lofts, and their latest iteration is as expensive homes and high-end retail. In fact, SoHo has become a shopping mecca: you'll find unique boutiques and chain stores (more of the latter these days), art galleries, home décor stores, salons, and spas. Thanks to the shops and SoHo's cool factor, tourists flock here during the day. It is somewhat quieter during the night, however.<br> It's also got a vibrant dining and bar scene  – you'll find Italian, Mexican, Russian, Seafood, Vietnamese, American, Mediterranean, French, Thai, and Japanese restaurants, burger joints, and a dozen cafes. At night there are plenty of bars and lounges to choose from to suit your speed.<br> Like its hip sister neighborhoods Tribeca and West Village, it costs to be cool. SoHo has consistently been one of the most expensive neighborhoods in New York for years.<br> SoHo is bordered on the north by the West Village and Greenwich Village, on the east by Little Italy, on the south by Tribeca, and on the west by the Hudson River.",

        "SoHo has some of the best people-watching in Manhattan, as it is a mecca for the trendy, sophisticated downtown elite.  The north-south running streets are often sites of fashion shoots as well as home to upscale European boutiques.  The east-west running streets are busier and always clogged with vendors selling everything from iPhone cases to incense.  One you hit Broadway, you could be in just about any mall in America with retail chains, tourists, teenagers, and disgruntled New Yorkers dominating the avenue.  The energy in SoHo is fast-paced and all hustle and bustle; it is a quintessentially vibrant New York neighborhood, but certainly not for the faint-of-heart or those looking for some peace and quiet.

        "Most buildings in SoHo are former textile factories, which make for incredible open floor plan apartments today, but caveat emptor, walls are nice sometimes. ",
        "The density of top-notch restaurants, galleries, and shops in SoHo cannot be matched.  Though geographically small, it's packed with trendy people and places. ",
        "Beware of weekends in SoHo.  Streets tend to be jammed with international tourists and bridge-and-tunnel types alike. ",

        "Named for its location “South of Houston” Street, SoHo is a contender for New York City’s most fashionable stomping ground.  The crowds are not for the faint of heart. Tourists come to SoHo for the people-watching, the food, and above all, the shopping.  Flagship retail chains dominate Broadway, eclectic boutiques are around every corner, and street vendors clog the busy, skinny streets. The gritty Bleecker Street Simon & Garfunkel sang of is a thing of the past; struggling artists have long since been replaced by residents with much more substantial bank accounts. Soho’s beautiful cobblestone streets are always teeming with tourists, shoppers, and photographers taking advantage of the photo-worthy cast-iron architecture. Most of the real estate options in SoHo are confined to walk-ups in historic cast-iron buildings and luxurious co-ops.  Vacancy and turnover rates are famously low. "

Living in Tribeca offers residents a dense urban feel and most residents rent their homes. In Tribeca there are a lot of bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and parks. Many families and young professionals live in Tribeca and residents tend to be liberal. The public schools in Tribeca are above average.",

My college campus is located in this area. It has great view of Hudson river. I especially like the side walk along the Hudson river. everyone can enjoy the great view for free and spend sometime to enjoy the fresh air when it is nice out there. The only bad thing about it is it got great location so everything is expensive here.",

The people are all so kind, there are plenty of parks for kids to hang out in, and the schools are all fantastic.

        "Tribeca was once the neighborhood of trailblazers who settled into the community before it was \"the place to be.\"  One would awaken to the aroma of the Martinson's Coffee warehouse located at what now is Robert DiNero's hotel and restaurant at the southwest corner of Greenwich and North Moore Streets.  On weekdays, one would encounter the hustle and bustle of  egg and cheese purveyors at their warehouses, that are now condo lofts, scattered throughout the neighborhood; now offices workers dominate those streets.  Evenings used to remind me of nights in the low desert of the Mojave Desert in Southern California, sans the cry of coyotes.  Now, there are street lights along Greenwich Street where  stop signs once were while teens used it as a football field.  The  peaceful nights, aromatic days, and easy commute attracted me to Tribeca.  The shopping, restaurants, and enviable housing deal keep me here, though not necessarily in that order.",

with one of my best friends from high school and college who was going to grad school at columbia i immediately booked a one-way ticket from tampa — my hometown — and told my roommate i trusted him completely to choose our new apartment i had no clue where i would be moving ; i was just so excited to make nyc my home my roommate sent me pictures of our future apartment and it was rental love at first sight i told him to sign on the spot the author on moving day after i told my uncle where my apartment was he has lived in nyc for over 30 years ; thus he acts just how you ’ d think he ripped me about 50 new assholes “ harlem are you crazy ” he asked “ do you know where that is do you know how dangerous it could be ” he wouldn ’ t stop making comparisons to my neighborhood and serpico and midnight cowboy and still hasn ’ t to this day the very next day he went to my neighborhood met my roommate for the first time and stood on my stoop for hours he walked around the neighborhood he talked to people on my block which i ’ m sincerely sad was not taped for my later entertainment he also walked around the neighborhood at night to give my father — his brother — a full report after he assured my dad the neighborhood wasn ’ t completely terrible but also pointing out the staircase in my building looked just like the one in a crack-den apartment in serpico he made me get mace which i still carry and named himself deputy commissioner of /u/i_keep_it_real_ ’ s security tepidly he gave three-fourths of his blessing i flew into jfk weeks later cabbed it to hamilton heights and promptly twirled about our beautiful big apartment carrie-style i went to explore the neighborhood which wasn ’ t scary to me at all it ’ s a mostly-dominican neighborhood complete with a mcdonalds that delivers only three blocks from my apartment sure i don ’ t live in carrie bradshaw ’ s new york but recently i realized that jay-z ’ s lyrics from “ empire state of mind ” are about my hood — yes that ’ s my mcdonald ’ s : i used to cop in harlem/all of my dominicanos right there up on broadway/brought me back to that mcdonald ’ s so no my neighborhood is not tribeca but it ’ s beautiful and cool in its own right i found my favorite places to eat and walk within time i ’ ve seen every ethnicity in my neighborhood : students families and everyone else – if i feel safe in harlem what is

a lone tumbleweed rolling down a deserted street landing at the door of a shady pawn shop do i feel safe i never haven ’ t here ’ s why : in new york everyone is crazy in some way — from larry david to michael bloomberg so if you go into any new york neighborhood under the assumption that everyone is crazy you will always have your guard up and your eyes forward do i get whistled at in the street “ ay mama ” sure but it ’ s no different than assholes in their first suits from barneys in financial district bars are thinking so it really doesn ’ t matter to me my roommate is muscular and black so when we walk down the street together people assume we ’ re just another hip racially mixed couple to not mess with we ’ re not he ’ s gay i like to pretend we ’ re lady gaga and usher taking a stroll just living our lives like my roommate and i harlem is eccentric it ’ s an urban norman rockwell painting tucked away next to the hudson river old men play chess on the sidewalks on overturned milk crates my dry cleaning guy waves at me every morning cheerfully sweeping his stoop in a wifebeater and tube socks as opposed to many other manhattan neighborhoods there are no women on macrobiotic diets dictating to nannies on the sidewalks on the contrary women in my neighborhood let their husbands have it in the middle of the street often wearing tropical-colored get-ups everyone is loony in their own charming way – there ’ s more to my neighborhood than its diversity from a girlish perspective my apartment features crown molding exposed brick and a washer/dryer in my bathroom from a real estate perspective the pre-war architecture of my neighborhood is incredible i don ’ t live in a shoebox and the rent is reasonable and from a thug perspective my address lends me a bit of street cred the cashier at my bodega says i keep it real jay-z and frank serpico have probably been here photo by author besides the duane reade alexander hamilton ’ s mansion is five minutes away the best pizza i ’ ve ever had — from a place that really does look like it was in serpico – is two blocks away and the biggest most authentic burritos i ’ ve ever had are across the street the west side highway jogging path and riverside park are a hop and a skip on hot days women sell shaved ice on the corner little kids play in the water of an open fire hydrant during summer a breathless homeless woman is always posted up at the liquor store 62 steps from my front stoop : “ canyouspareadollarcanyouspareadollar… ” – in some ways moving to harlem on a whim was like a drunken vegas wedding everyone thought would get annulled “ but i love it ” i wailed to my parents almost three years later harlem and i are still going strong it ’ s true — they say when you know you know carrie and samantha once had this exchange on sex and the city : carrie says “ i have to go to san francisco on a book tour. ” samantha replies “ you wouldn ’ t go to the upper west side suddenly you ’ re going to san francisco ” and ramona from real housewives made an inference that women brawl on the street 10 blocks north of me my reply : what the hell is wrong with the west side carrie and guess what the scariest thing is at the corner of 150th ramona a taco bell and a kfc yes i ’ m a girl who stereotypically doesn ’ t fit the bill to live here and i do love having girlish brunches downtown and am envious of people who live near gramercy park—but that doesn ’ t mean i can ’ t prevail in harlem nah mean /u/i_keep_it_real_ is an editorial assistant for advance publication ’ s reddit.com she does

        "advice are you moving this winter read this i know how difficult moving in the winter can be going out there when it's freezing cold to see apartments is no fun i work in real estate so i've used my experience plus the most recent advice posts on r/nycapartments to create this small q & a for people moving this winter : **first question most people ask -** where do i live which is the safest neighborhood where are the cheapest apartments - let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you ’ d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you ’ d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you ’ d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have",

After the terrorist attacks of 9/11 drastically reduced business around this part of the city, de Niro (and others) started the now famous Tribeca Film Festival to bring investment and acclaim to this neighborhood.<br> It worked: today Tribeca is a vibrant, safe place to live…and one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the city. Living in one of the beautiful renovated builds or the new luxury condos will set you back quite a bit: the median home price here is $4.4 million. However, residents and visitors alike rave about the community vibe and friendly, laid back people. It's also got one of the best public schools in the city. And nearly 1 in 5 residents here are expats.<br> You won't find the dense shopping that some of the adjacent neighborhoods have, but Tribeca does have a mix of unique stores and covers your basic needs, like a grocery store. There are plenty of dining options ranging from comfort food to high-end restaurants.<br> Tribeca is bordered on the north by SoHo, on the east by Chinatown and the Civic Center, on the south by the Financial District, and on the west by the Hudson River.",
        "Tribeca is the epitome of downtown cool, a slice of urban jungle that’s as hip as SoHo, but without the tourists and the congestion. ",
        "Tribeca is an upscale neighborhood known for high-end real estate and well-heeled residents — a downtown haven for European cars and pedigreed dogs.  It's also a truly gorgeous area that mixes glorious old cast-iron lofts, wide cobblestone streets, and dramatic new buildings.  Decades ago, these lofts housed artists and squatters.  But the bohemians have given way to cool-seekers with bigger bank accounts.  Now, this neighborhood is among the most expensive places to live in the city.  That hasn't cost the neighborhood much of its sophistication, though.  Nightlife in Tribeca remains busy but refined, attracting a cosmopolitan crowd with an appreciation for the finer things in life. ",
        "Upscale restaurants and boutiques make up Tribeca’s chic commercial center, while quiet cobblestone streets and impressive loft buildings lend the area an air of tranquility. ",
        "The Odeon, a brassiere and retro haven for artists and locals alike, has been open since the 1980s and epitomizes Tribeca's insider allure. ",
        "A cast-iron footbridge spans Staples Street, a teeny alley off Duane Park, and connects a building on Hudson Street to a townhouse on Jay Street. ",
        "You cannot ask for a more central Downtown Manhattan neighborhood, or for better subway access. ",
        "Real estate in Tribeca is extremely expensive, and the neighborhood can have a rarefied, snooty feel at times. ",
        "Tribeca is the most expensive neighborhood in New York City, but for those who can afford it, it is a wonderful place to live. ",
        "Tribeca's signature restaurant, the Odeon, perfectly captures the effortlessly cool vibe of the neighborhood.  This place is nothing if not chic. Many architectural remnants of Tribeca's industrial past remain.  Old warehouses renovated into large, beautiful, light-filled lofts now fetch some of the highest prices per square foot in the city. Its proximity to the Financial District is a boon for many professionals. While Tribeca once was the heart of Manhattan’s artists' community, now it’s one of the top neighborhoods for celebrity-spotting. Some of the most popular attractions in Tribeca are the excellent restaurants, world-class shopping, and the few high-end art galleries that remain in the neighborhood. "

        "Two Bridges is a tiny neighborhood in lower Manhattan sandwiched between the Manhattan Bridge and Brooklyn Bridge. Most New Yorkers have never heard of (including this author, who lived in the city for years). But being under-the-radar is just the way its residents like it. Unlike some of its neighbors it hasn't been gentrified yet, leaving an old school, affordable neighborhood of long-time residents and brick walk-ups (though new development is creeping in). There is also a large public housing development in the southern corner of the neighborhood.<br> Because Chinatown is next door and due to a recent influx of immigrants from the Fujian province in China, most of the popular restaurants here are Chinese. However, you also have some coffee shops and other types of food available.<br> Two Bridges is bordered on the north by the Lower East Side, on the east by the East River, on the south by Civic Center, and on the west by Chinatown."

This was scary. Since then there has not been a problem, but I am very cautious when buzzing someone into the building.",
        "Within the past year a woman was struck and killed by a school bus on an unmarked, unpatrolled crosswalk. The crosswalk possibly wasn't marked due the the second avenue subway's constant change of sidewalk routes, i.e., barricades protuding into the road to create a walkable route.",

        "The Upper East Side is great if you are white and rich. Personally, I am not, so my experience may be a bit biased. I was raised here--went to elementary and middle school in the area. Of course, I was one of VERY few students of color. It's gotten a bit better over the years, but the expense of living here is just far too high for many underprivileged minority groups to afford, which leads to more school segregation and overall racial and economic disparity within NYC. Overall, the UES is family-friendly, has great schools, restaurants, museums, parks, subways are accessible, and it's generally safe, though if I were given the opportunity to raise my future children in the city , I would choose a more diverse neighborhood.",
        "I have lived in New York City all my life and despite hip neighbors popping throughout the city, I believe that the Upper East Side is still one of the best residential neighborhoods. The Upper East Side has a homey feel without the crowds and overwhelming sensation of more commercial neighborhoods in the city.",

There are also a lot of opportunities for public transport which makes it easy to reach. It is very safe and a great school district.",
        "I love the UES. It is beautiful, artistic, and cultured. The restaurants are amazing, the fashion culture is beautiful to see, and it has the perfect amount of tourism. There is a very clear community of locals, but we get New Yorkers from all over the city visiting each day.",
        "It's expensive and white, but it's a pretty nice place. Everything is pretty convenient to reach. There are multiple trains and buses that can easily be accessed. There are lots of places to eat -- overpriced, of course, but still there nonetheless. Central Park and the Carl Schurz Park are a nice walk away and really nice to visit. It can get bust at times, obviously, but if you're into that then it's great.",
        "The upper east side feels safe and has a lot to offer between great places to grab a drink or eat. It is easy to meet people and there is always something to do. The area is pretty clean in comparison to some others, but is a little pricy.",
        "Having grown up on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, I can tell you there is no better place to grow up. No matter where you are in the neighborhood, you are always walking distance from a park such as, Central Park, Carl Schurz, John Jay and others. Also, you still get that city feel while being away from the heart of it all. Very unique and there is no place I would have preferred to grow up.",
        "I am able to live in a safe, quiet, comfortable area while being able to afford rent.  I have lived in multiple areas of Manhattan, and the UES is definitely a \"bubble\" of sorts, but if you are seeking an area without many downsides, as long as you are ok living a bit far from the subway in a tiny apartment, this is the area for you.",
        "Have been living in the Upper East Side of Manhattan for over 7 years now, and I  always feel safe. Although its safety and family friendliness is something everyone can agree is true here, there is a lack of diversity seen through age, race, and economic status. It's the Aspen of Colorado- Hamptons of Long Island- or Beverly Hills of California. Not everyone can afford it, but its a great area for  visitors to grab a bite!",
        "I think that the people are very friendly here and that the sense of community is wonderful. I see people walking their dogs all the time or strolling past stores, and it makes my time here all the more enjoyable. Traffic is a problem from time to time, though.",

Living near the park has been essential to my mental health and has given me great focus when it comes to my education. New York can be so overwhelming and congested, but the Upper East Side is like nowhere else: it is quiet, calm and extremely friendly. I can't imagine living anywhere else in New York.",
        "Friendly, clean, and many great restaurants! There are subways and buses in this neighborhood that typically run on schedule.  There are convenience stores, gyms, coffee shops, and schools all within walking distance.",
        "Great neighborhood, especially now that the Second Avenue subway has opened, making public transportation throughout the City much more efficient. Lots of great restaurants and cafes.",

        "questions on subway station density & placement it should be noted that i'm not from nyc but this is my perspective as a resident of the sf bay area which has a much lower overall population density to start lower manhattan looks too dense with 14/18/23/28/34 sts on the 1 having their station exits a 4-5 minute walk away from each other at most i'm assuming the succession made sense with the original shorter irt platform lengths and lower population density at the time of construction but if that were the case why not close 18 st as was done with its lex av counterpart during platform extensions was it rather that the lex av 18 st had to be closed because of the offset platforms at union square crosstown access seems like a pain in the ass with the g being the only rail service ; i presume it's made worse by only having 4-car trains and some awkward station spacing would the section between broadway and 21 st have benefitted from having 2 or 3 more stations as for the second avenue subway : only 3 stations between 63 and 96 sts and no express services in the high-density upper east side ^i'm ^aware ^of ^the ^construction ^cost ^but ^that ^just ^seems ^like ^its ^own ^massive ^problem my overall perception is that stations should be set up such that each one by foot would be somewhere around a 7 to 12 minute walk away from each other depending on locale/population density ; is this a valid viewpoint or an oversimplification and more general questions : * **what works and what does n't about current nyc subway station spacing ** * **if given the opportunity what would you change about station placement assuming overall alignment ca n't be altered ** this can be at any scale from adding/removing individual exits to redoing the system with the same rows",

let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you ’ d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you ’ d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you ’ d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have",

One of Manhattan's larger neighborhoods, it includes the sub-neighborhoods of Yorkville and Lenox Hill.<br> This is a culturally rich neighborhood, boasting a large number of museums, including the famous Metropolitan Museum of Art, the beehive shaped Guggenheim Collection Museum, The Frick, Neue Galerie, Cooper Hewitt Design Museum, the Jewish Museum, Asia Society Museum, Mount Vernon Hotel Museum & Garden, and Gracie Mansion, the official home of New York City's mayors.<br> There are a wide range of dining options, ranging from low key diners to some of the best (and most expensive) restaurants in Manhattan. Along Madison are plenty of luxury retail shops to cater to the UES' wealthy residents. There are also more affordable options for the mere mortals who don't have a seven figure bank account and live in the area.<br> There is lots of green space as well. To the west of the neighborhood you've got the iconic 840 acre Central Park with miles of walking and running paths, an ice rink in winter, concerts in summer, the Central Park Zoo, woodlands and ponds, a public pool, restaurants, and plenty of green space to play Frisbee or just lay in the sun. Along the East River the Carl Shurz Park offers 15 acres for walking, running, and biking. It also has two dog runs, athletic courts, playgrounds, and two pools. A number of schools cater to local families.<br> As mentioned, the UES does include two sub-neighborhoods: Lenox Hills and Yorkville. Lenox Hill, which encompasses the southern part of the UES and directly abuts Turtle Bay, has a distinctly younger and more energetic vibe than the neighborhood at large and you'll find a population of young professionals living in the brownstones and high rises here. Yorkville, in the upper northeast section of the UES, has traditionally been a quiet and more affordable area, which has also made it popular with young professionals and families. The extension of the 2nd Avenue subway line to Yorkville has spurred new development and increasing home prices.<br> The Upper East Side is bordered on the north by East Harlem, on the east by the East River, on the south by Turtle Bay, and on the west by Central Park.",
        "The Upper East Side is synonymous with classic New York sophistication, but this huge swath of the city actually encompasses many diverse lifestyles.  Stately mansions and designer boutiques west of Lexington Avenue give way to a much younger, more affordable scene in Yorkville. ",
        "When many people think of the Upper East Side, they think of a quiet, tree-lined urban expanse filled with posh residents and purebred dogs.  There's some reality behind the neighborhood's old-money image: The blocks between Park and Fifth avenues are home to some of Manhattan's wealthiest residents, many of whom dwell in stately co-ops or sleek new condos overseen by stiffly collared doormen.  But there's a lot more happening on the Upper East Side.  Museum Mile throngs with tourists, street artists, and lovers of the arts, drawn to its abundance of high culture.  And the eastern side of the neighborhood, toward Yorkville, exhibits a less rarefied character.  Second Avenue is home to sports bars, pubs, and some excellent restaurants.  A trendy renaissance is in the offing here, sparked by young professionals drawn by some surprisingly good housing prices (for Manhattan).  The avenues and commerce-lined thoroughfares can be hectic, but many streets on the Upper East Side are blessedly quiet — just one more way in which this oft-stereotyped neighborhood can be a surprise. ",
        "Close to many tourist destinations, the UES is always lively, but the historic architecture, clean sidewalks, and manicured flowerbeds give it a calm, unhurried atmosphere. ",
        "Central Park is the Upper East Side's crown jewel.  From jogging around the reservoir to sprawling on the Great Lawn, the range of activities here appeals to both tourists and locals. ",
        "Fifth Avenue was once lined with huge mansions built by the oligarchs of the Gilded Age, like the Rockefellers, Carnegies, and Vanderbilts. ",
        "One of the most beautiful neighborhoods in the city, the Upper East Side feels a lot like Paris: cosmopolitan, refined, and set apart from the chaos of the rest of the city. ",
        "If you crave warm sunlight, this may not be your place: The UES is home to many newer high-rise buildings, which can cast long shadows over the neighborhood's breezy streets. ",
        "The real estate along Fifth Avenue and Park Avenue is some of the most expensive in the city, but as you move farther from the park, prices become much more moderate —especially for co-ops and rentals. ",
        "Central Parks's reservoir, boathouse, and Great Lawn are all easily accessible from the Upper East Side. The Upper East Side remains synonymous with classic New York sophistication. Museum Mile is a major tourist destination: The Frick Collection, the Met, the Neue Galerie, and the Guggenheim are all within 10 blocks of each other. The Upper East Side boasts safe streets and countless playgrounds. With tons of restaurants, bars, coffee shops, schools, supermarkets, libraries, and cultural sites, there’s rarely a reason to leave. "

That is when you can jog outside and enjoy the weather and explore the city more.",
        "I am not as familiar with job opportunities in this neighborhood as I have never working directly in the area that I live in. That being said the Upper West Side is quite residential so there are few corporations and or business offices in the neighborhood. \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of restaurants and new coffee shops in the neighborhood so there are probably more opportunities for service jobs then any other occupation in this area",

        "I honestly have not been aware of crimes and safety considering my neighborhood is safe to me but others I am not too sure, everyone has their own different situation in this area.",
        "Many more unsafe feeling situations than further downtown.",
        "I think its bad even though I live here and I am used to the occasional violent action that usually goes on in a projects area. But unlike me for people who do not live in this type of environment for them it is very scary and usually prefer not to come to these types of areas.",
        "No real issues of serious crime and I feel safe, although my Dad's car was vandalized recently (first time in 21 years).",
        "Because I am not fully submerged in this topic, I can not say for sure wether crime and safety rates are at their best or not.",
        "This has gotten increasingly better.",
        "The Upper West Side is the second safest neighborhood in Manhattan, statistically speaking (right after Central Park). The area has a heavy concentration of wealth and families. This leads to a community that is actively improving their neighborhood and ensuring it's safety.

        "The Upper West Side is a wonderful place to live if you want to spend a few years in New York City. It's proximity to midtown Manhattan is great and there  are several subways that can you take you almost anywhere in the 5 boroughs. The Upper West Side has both family owned businesses and chains to give a nice taste of NYC. The only reason that I would give it a 4/5 is that it can be quite expensive to rent or buy an apartment here and they not super large.",
        "This is the most beautiful and the safest part of NYC. Nowhere in NYC is going to be pretty or safe if the current leadership doesn't clean up their act and clean up the streets. It's been so sad to watch the neighborhood decline with the rise in drug use and crime (which is happening, despite what the \"official\" reports say--the only reason those show record lows is because the city has stopped acting on certain offenses at the orders of the esteemed idiot).",
        "Living in Upper West Side (Columbia University community) overall is great. However, if you want to go outside especially in the evening, you should take extra care of yourself.",

        "I grew up in the upper west side, right by central park and it was great. Beautiful, quiet, calm. I was on the very upper end so it was a little less quiet and a little less safe than lower, but things have improved in recent years, I believe. I wish housing was more reasonable in size and pricing.",
        "I love the Upper West Side. I love the community, I love the culture. I love the easy access to so many museum and the closeness to those in the Upper East Side. I multitude of parks is refreshing and I appreciate the amount of green space that there is in such a metropolitan area.",

        "The upper west side is a good neighborhood. Not too crazy and pretty nice. Things are expensive, but I like the atmosphere and people.",
        "So much shopping but things are shutting down. The rent is high and supermarkets are disappearing. There is Trader Joe’s which is a good place and there is a DSW and Marshalls, Sephora, and my favorite, Lush. Aside from the shutting down it is still a fun, convenient, and happening place to live",

        "The housing is great, there is really no issue in terms of the aesthetic or how well homes are taken care of. I don't mind the occasional graffiti so this is not really an issue for me. The biggest issue with the neighborhood is the dramatically rising cost of housing. \r\n\r\nI would say the best placed to reside in this neighborhood are near the riverside park or central park. Also the neighboring areas around Columbia University/Barnard/City College are beautiful and more reasonably priced.",

There are new restuarants constantly opening up as well as the old timers which have been in the neighborhood for some time but remain delicious. \r\n\r\nThere are a good number of new coffee shops that have opened up which have definitely been welcomed in the area. Currently some of my favorites are Irving Farm Roasters, Box Kite, and Aroma. They all have great food options as well. \r\n\r\nAs well the upper west side is known for having a large Jewish populaiton, as such there are great food options like Zabars (super marker), Barney's Greengass, and Fine and Shapiro that serve delicious lox, bagels, and pastrami. The best bagel in NYC is also at Absolute Bagels.",

The facility is pleasant, clean and the staff are very polite, and they'll always go out of their way to assist you. I also volunteer at a local soup kitchen, and much of our food comes from Whole Foods, in the form of gifts. They're a wholesome company, as their name suggests, and they take their customers seriously and regard them with respect.",

        "my first suggestion would be to search for apartments based on whatever subway lines is closest to your school e.g anything that is nearby the subway stops along the the a b c d and 1 subway lines you can check on the mta's map here for what the closest stops are that way you wo n't have to worry about transferring from one train to another which is common for many on commuting to work myself included & nbsp ; ahead of all that you will definitely need to learn how to navigate the subway at some point in time there's no easy 1-2-3 guide for this and a youtube is probably faster but going by looking at the mta subway map plus the key shown there on the top-right corner plus when in doubt always ask a friendly face e.g an officer security any mta workers you come across booth agents anyone who is n't in a rush better to ask then to get lost below are my top few points when going anywhere by train at least & nbsp ; * technically every stop black and white dots is a **local stop** where all **local trains** stop at * white dots though mean that that stop is also an **express stop** these are the only stops **express trains** go to within that borough * and for both points above : these are not always true though on the weekends and/or due to never-ending construction so always check google maps the mta app and any other train-apps you use for help on how to navigate from one stop to another & nbsp ; for example take the 1/2/3 train lines these are the lines marked as red in the map notice how the 1 train is listed on every stop on the red line you can consider that the *local train* and look again to the white dots along the red lines see how they're marked as 2 or 3 this means the 2 and 3 are the *express trains* at least in manhattan once you go to another borough though like brooklyn at that point the trains can differ from being `` express'' in manhattan to `` local'' in brooklyn so again take a good look at the maps for where you need to go identify the trains you need and more importantly if lost ask someone & nbsp ; as for neighborhoods to look in i'd check anywhere within inwood washington heights upper west side uws and west of harlem anything nearby columbia university as starting points for your search if you're looking to stay along the 1 train",

with one of my best friends from high school and college who was going to grad school at columbia i immediately booked a one-way ticket from tampa — my hometown — and told my roommate i trusted him completely to choose our new apartment i had no clue where i would be moving ; i was just so excited to make nyc my home my roommate sent me pictures of our future apartment and it was rental love at first sight i told him to sign on the spot the author on moving day after i told my uncle where my apartment was he has lived in nyc for over 30 years ; thus he acts just how you ’ d think he ripped me about 50 new assholes “ harlem are you crazy ” he asked “ do you know where that is do you know how dangerous it could be ” he wouldn ’ t stop making comparisons to my neighborhood and serpico and midnight cowboy and still hasn ’ t to this day the very next day he went to my neighborhood met my roommate for the first time and stood on my stoop for hours he walked around the neighborhood he talked to people on my block which i ’ m sincerely sad was not taped for my later entertainment he also walked around the neighborhood at night to give my father — his brother — a full report after he assured my dad the neighborhood wasn ’ t completely terrible but also pointing out the staircase in my building looked just like the one in a crack-den apartment in serpico he made me get mace which i still carry and named himself deputy commissioner of /u/i_keep_it_real_ ’ s security tepidly he gave three-fourths of his blessing i flew into jfk weeks later cabbed it to hamilton heights and promptly twirled about our beautiful big apartment carrie-style i went to explore the neighborhood which wasn ’ t scary to me at all it ’ s a mostly-dominican neighborhood complete with a mcdonalds that delivers only three blocks from my apartment sure i don ’ t live in carrie bradshaw ’ s new york but recently i realized that jay-z ’ s lyrics from “ empire state of mind ” are about my hood — yes that ’ s my mcdonald ’ s : i used to cop in harlem/all of my dominicanos right there up on broadway/brought me back to that mcdonald ’ s so no my neighborhood is not tribeca but it ’ s beautiful and cool in its own right i found my favorite places to eat and walk within time i ’ ve seen every ethnicity in my neighborhood : students families and everyone else – if i feel safe in harlem what is the lingering stigma about harlem that makes people scared for me first frankly it ’ s because i ’ m not a big black thug second there ’ s the crime history third i think harlem makes people think of a lone tumbleweed rolling down a deserted street landing at the door of a shady pawn shop do i feel safe i never haven ’ t here ’ s why : in new york everyone is crazy in some way — from larry david to michael bloomberg so if you go into any new york neighborhood under the assumption that everyone is crazy you will always have your guard up and your eyes forward do i get whistled at in the street “ ay mama ” sure but it ’ s no different than assholes in their first suits from barneys in financial district bars are thinking so it really doesn ’ t matter to me my roommate is muscular and black so when we walk down the street together people assume we ’ re just another hip racially mixed couple to not mess with we ’ re not he ’ s gay i like to pretend we ’ re lady gaga and usher taking a stroll just living our lives like my roommate and i harlem is eccentric it ’ s an urban norman rockwell painting tucked away next to the hudson river old men play chess on the sidewalks on overturned milk crates my dry cleaning guy waves at me every morning cheerfully sweeping his stoop in a wifebeater and tube socks as opposed to many other manhattan neighborhoods there are no women on macrobiotic diets dictating to nannies on the sidewalks on the contrary women in my neighborhood let their husbands have it in the middle of the street often wearing tropical-colored get-ups everyone is loony in their own charming way – there ’ s more to my neighborhood than its diversity from a girlish perspective my apartment features crown molding exposed brick and a washer/dryer in my bathroom from a real estate perspective the pre-war architecture of my neighborhood is incredible i don ’ t live in a shoebox and the rent is reasonable and from a thug perspective my address lends me a bit of street cred the cashier at my bodega says i keep it real jay-z and frank serpico have probably been here photo by author besides the duane reade alexander hamilton ’ s mansion is five minutes away the best pizza i ’ ve ever had — from a place that really does look like it was in serpico – is two blocks away and the biggest most authentic burritos i ’ ve ever had are across the street the west side highway jogging path and riverside park are a hop and a skip on hot days women sell shaved ice on the corner little kids play in the water of an open fire hydrant during summer a breathless homeless woman is always posted up at the liquor store 62 steps from my front stoop : “ canyouspareadollarcanyouspareadollar… ” – in some ways moving to harlem on a whim was like a drunken vegas wedding everyone thought would get annulled “ but i love it ” i wailed to my parents almost three years later harlem and i are still going strong it ’ s true — they say when you know you know carrie and samantha once had this exchange on sex and the city : carrie says “ i have to go to san francisco on a book tour. ” samantha replies “ you wouldn ’ t go to the upper west side suddenly you ’ re going to san francisco ” and ramona from real housewives made an inference that women brawl on the street 10 blocks north of me my reply : what the hell is wrong with the west side carrie and guess what the scariest thing is at the corner of 150th ramona a taco bell and a kfc yes i ’ m a girl who stereotypically doesn ’ t fit the bill to live here and i do love having girlish brunches downtown and am envious of people who live near gramercy park—but that doesn ’ t mean i can ’ t prevail in harlem nah mean /u/i_keep_it_real_ is an editorial assistant for advance publication ’ s reddit.com she does not have any other cool articles on /r/circlejerknyc and probably never will after referencing sex and the city twice — twice — in this post but if you ever need to know how to make a pirate hat she ’

let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you ’ d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you ’ d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you ’ d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have",

On the east of the neighborhood you've got the iconic 840 acre Central Park with miles of walking and running paths, an ice rink in winter, concerts in summer, the Central Park Zoo, woodlands and ponds, a public pool, restaurants, and plenty of green space to play Frisbee or just lay in the sun. On the west, bordering the Hudson River, is Riverside Park, which offers 330 acres of biking, walking, and running, a marina, dog runs, sports fields, playgrounds, a skate park, and the Boat Basin Café – a great place to have a beer at sunset.<br> At the southern edge of the neighborhood is Columbus Circle, a transit hub which also has a mall, restaurants, and hotel in the Time Warner Center. Heading north into the core of the neighborhood, most shopping, restaurants, and bars tend to be located on Amsterdam or Columbus Avenues. You'll find a range of chain stores and unique boutiques for retail options, and laid back diners to celebrity chef spots for dining.<br> When it comes to the arts, you're close to all the music and performances at Lincoln Center and the mesmerizing American Museum of Natural History.<br> Everyday conveniences like pharmacies and grocery stores are never far away. There are also dozens of schools for children of all ages.<br> All of this adds up to a great neighborhood for young professionals and families alike and it's one of Manhattan's most beloved areas.<br> The Upper West Side is bordered on the north by Morningside Heights and Harlem, on the east by Central Park, on the south by Hell's Kitchen, and on the west by the Hudson River.",

        "I like the diversity and how there is a lot of college students in the area. There are also elementary schools and endless opportunities.",
        "Washington Heights is brimming with diversity and is in proximate distance to everything in both Manhattan and the Bronx. It has a rich history as a neighborhood and has largely preserved that heritage. The neighborhood's affordability has been shifting for the last few decades, becoming increasingly gentrified. However, native residents are still very much in the neighborhood. Dominican and Latin American businesses and restaurants are in ample supply in Washington Heights.",
        "I went to school here - Yeshiva university is a great school located here in Washington Heights. There were lots of places for me to eat lunch and i did feel safe for the most part when commuting to and from Soho.",
        "Washington Heights is the Bronx with Manhattan prices - same discount stores, same population of Dominicans, same Spanish-speaking restaurants, etc., all in danger of gentrification because poor or cheapo white people (I know a debt ridden moocher who lives here) don't mind pricing out longtime residents just to boast they have a \"Manhattan address\" Please. Move to the Bronx instead and get over yourself.",
        "What I like about Washington Heights is that is a diverse community. Everyone is always around or trying to help out others.  They have a lot of upcoming stores and job opportunities. What I would like to see change is the parking arrangements, It is so hard to find parking around the neighborhood so with all these upcoming stores we hardly have parking now imagine how much harder it will be once all the stores (target, NY&Co, etc) are up and running.",
        "Great place to raise a family and enjoy everything New York has to offer without the hassle of living directly in the city.",
        "I have spent the majority of my living in Washington heights.  It is a community that I was born to love.  Many of Dominicans reside in Washington Heights and everyone is so friendly.  One thing I would change is the cleanliness of the streets.",
        "Washington Heights is full of great hispanic culture. It is a very convenient place to live in in the city considering it is very close to the city. However, drugs are still very prevalent.",
        "I have lived in Washington Heights for 18 years and I still very much love it to this day. While many safety issues could change, I think the neighborhood is very unique and can continue to grow in many ways.",

        "It is a great diverse neighborhood with easy access to all of new york city and all it has to offer.",
        "WASHINGTON HEIGHTS HAS A SERENE ATMOSPHERE, AND FAMILY CENTRIC NEIGHBORHOODS.  AND, THE RENTS ARE ON THE AFFORDABLE SIDE. WOULD LOVE TO SEE BROADWAY GET CLEANED UP.",
        "The Heights feel very familiar, being from Puerto Rico and having spent years living in a community with a large Dominican population, but it is so much more than that. There are many good restaurants to choose from, a beautiful theater, bustling city life, and the impressive sights surrounding the Washington Bridge. There are also many gorgeous churches, plenty of schools and community centers to choose from, and a lifestyle close enough to the rest of Manhattan to make contact with it easy, but considerably less expensive. And last but not least, the Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, and many doctors' offices that take all sorts of medical plans. It's a pretty good place to live or pass through.",
        "Great restaurants and foods. Vegetables an Fruits are with great prices. The majority of people are from the Dominican Republic. Schools are not very good.",
        "Located in northern Manhattan, I enjoy that Washington Heights is a safe are of New York City. It's close to good restaurants all along 181st St., close to parks (like Riverside Park), and near reliable transit. It's also a growing community given the amount of students that are coming up to this area to be closer to the CUMC campus. I feel happy to have found a neighborhood that I can thoroughly recommend to friends, and still be close to the family I have across the GWB!",
        "My experience living in Washington Heights has been pretty good. I got settled here in the year 2000 with my Dad and sisters. My aunt and cousins' live only a block away from us which meant constant small gatherings during holidays and or outings together. It is a neighborhood that is referred to as \"The mini Domincan Republic\" because the majority of residents living here are of Dominican descent. I was blessed to meet my now best friend of 15 plus years here. Renting here is fairly cheap and the location is very convenient with your A, C and 1 trains being within walking distance. Every street is tree lined and because the neighborhood sits right above Harlem and just below the Bronx every resident is blessed to look out of their window to see the great views of either the Hudson River, Bronx and or New Jersey.",
        "My neighborhood is becoming more and more diverse and multi-cultural. It is a large area with bounteous kinds of transportation hubs. Hence, people from all over are there. The only downside is the police do not crack down on the crack epidemic there, the drug addicts always are in front of churches and public areas, making it feel a bit unsafe.",
        "Living  near a park it is nice to see different peoples enjoying the same activities. There are a lot of dogs around. Great food, great culture , and great peoples",
        "I love the area, lucky to have been raised here and see it grow. Lots of nice restaurants in my area and a more affordable part of the city. There are lots of beautiful parks and a true sense of community. I know almost everyone in my neighborhood.",
        "Washington heights is a neighborhood that is changing very fast recently. Lots of cafe's and restaurant have been opened last  2 years. The main residents of this neighborhood are Dominicans and there are so mane Spanish stores there. The safest and nicest area is by the Riverside Drive close to the Presbyterian Hospital. The area is supported by 2 train lines and they are working fine. Except  of few bars by 150st most of the neighborhood is not night life friendly.",
        "There are a lot of older buildings that need renovation",
        "The quality of housing is okay because its very hard to find affordable places to live in New York City. Their are many abandoned properties in the right side of my block. Some of best areas to reside  in are located on  the upper north side.\r\n\r\n.",
        "Many of the building in the area are old but it's a decent area.",
        "Area is pretty noisy during the summertime.",
        "Living in my area is okay, you'll manage the noise.",
        "Housing has become very expensive, rent has increased",
        "It could be worse, it is standard New York City apartment housing.",
        "Most of the housing I. This area is substandard",
        "It's alright, because it is New York, after all...",
        "NY is very exspensive.Low income families stay on the waiting list for years.",
        "Urban Upper Manhattan- not much to say.",
        "There are many small businesses around my are functional and decently priced.",
        "Many similar restaurants, but they are in high demand.",
        "Riverbank, Riverside, and other local parks are near by whenever anyone wants to spend some time with nature. Central Park and Van Cortland Park are also within a reasonable distance.",
        "If you go outside you may see pieces of nature but it is not sufficient for everyone.",
        "Food is really bad in this area. There are selected few that actually know what they are doing.",
        "Local businesses are very convenient in both location and money wise but the quality is low.",
        "For the most part, it's convenient.",
        "The food around here is mostly Hispanic. Being Hispanic myself, it's great. I enjoy the meals all the time. Lately in the past two years, it's expanding to have foods of other nationalities and even healthier restaurants. The area is slowly but surely expanding it's variety.",
        "Around this area, everything is basically very local. Most, if not all, are owned by people of Hispanic descent. They are very helpful, and you can find what you need. There isn't anything you really can't find.",
        "Everything is so dirty. It's sad.",
        "Not the healthiest but it'll do.",
        "Local businesses are really nearby and easy to get to by walking.",
        "A lot of dominican food which gets old if you are not dominican, i think. I like chipotle honestly and the thai place Tung Thong is very good. No really places to go \"out\", especially not dancing/clubbing. Heights tavern is a good bar, never been to Coogans but people like it.",
        "Sort of run-down, although prices are cheap",
        "There are not enough diverse restaurants.",
        "I cannot find everything I need in this area. Most of all there is not enough laundromat so its always crowded and the machines are not always working.",
        "They did the play ground over. There is a play ground on the block that I believe is housing property but its been closed for years. No one came to fix it yet.",

        "The stores in my area are not upscale.",

        "my first suggestion would be to search for apartments based on whatever subway lines is closest to your school e.g anything that is nearby the subway stops along the the a b c d and 1 subway lines you can check on the mta's map here for what the closest stops are that way you wo n't have to worry about transferring from one train to another which is common for many on commuting to work myself included & nbsp ; ahead of all that you will definitely need to learn how to navigate the subway at some point in time there's no easy 1-2-3 guide for this and a youtube is probably faster but going by looking at the mta subway map plus the key shown there on the top-right corner plus when in doubt always ask a friendly face e.g an officer security any mta workers you come across booth agents anyone who is n't in a rush better to ask then to get lost below are my top few points when going anywhere by train at least & nbsp ; * technically every stop black and white dots is a **local stop** where all **local trains** stop at * white dots though mean that that stop is also an **express stop** these are the only stops **express trains** go to within that borough * and for both points above : these are not always true though on the weekends and/or due to never-ending construction so always check google maps the mta app and any other train-apps you use for help on how to navigate from one stop to another & nbsp ; for example take the 1/2/3 train lines these are the lines marked as red in the map notice how the 1 train is listed on every stop on the red line you can consider that the *local train* and look again to the white dots along the red lines see how they're marked as 2 or 3 this means the 2 and 3 are the *express trains* at least in manhattan once you go to another borough though like brooklyn at that point the trains can differ from being `` express'' in manhattan to `` local'' in brooklyn so again take a good look at the maps for where you need to go identify the trains you need and more importantly if lost ask someone & nbsp ; as for neighborhoods to look in i'd check anywhere within inwood washington heights upper west side uws and west of harlem anything nearby columbia university as starting points for your search if you're looking to stay along the 1 train",

        "the ideal routing for a subway route is to have the express go to the end of the line and the local to stop short maybe about 5-8 stations in from the end of the line this is because in most cases in the outer boroughs there are n't enough passengers to justify running express all the way to the end start from the end pick up a bunch of people at the next few stops and then run express one of the best implementations of this is a/c in inwood/washington heights there the c can terminate at 168th without any interference at all with a train on the 6 they try to implement a similar pattern but there are some hiccups due to the track layout near parkchester for those on the outer stations they put up with the delays there since then their train will run express all the way to 125th the alternative running expresses to parkchester and running the local all the way to pelham bay would be better for train efficiency but is less convenient for passengers as most will all get off at parkchester wait in the heat or cold and then transfer to an express this is a frequent pattern on other lines due to the track layout like at utica ave on 3/4 and at brighton beach",

studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you ’ d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you ’ d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you ’ d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have",
        "This solidly working class neighborhood has great parks and views across the Hudson.",
        "Washington Heights, also known as 'Little Dominican Republic', is a hilly neighborhood way up in the northern part of Manhattan island. Gentrification has just begun to reach this area so it's still an affordable place to live.<br> There are a number of restaurants here, as well as some bars, but you won't find a ton of variety. Shopping is fairly limited as well; besides staples like grocery stores and pharmacies, there are lots of cheap retail stores lining the streets. But there is a lot of energy here and residents describe a strong community vibe. Fort Tryon Park offers 67 acres of paths, basketball courts, playgrounds, the Cloisters medieval museum, and the largest dog run in Manhattan. It's also got a burgeoning art scene.<br> Washington Heights is bordered on the north by Hudson Heights and Fort George, on the east by the Harlem River, on the south by Hamilton Heights, and on the west by the Hudson River.",
        "Diverse with an abundance of local flavor, Washington Heights is a tight-knit community north of Harlem. ",
        "Washington Heights is so far uptown that it feels a little removed from the action, which translates into affordable rents and large apartments in predominately prewar buildings.  Popular with young professionals and students, the neighborhood is vibrant, thriving, and decidedly down-to-earth.  Expansive parks make it a popular place for dog owners.  At its core, the neighborhood has always been diverse; throw into the mix plenty of Columbia Med School students in scrubs and off-duty cops, and that will round out the scene at many a happy hour in the Heights. ",
        "Washington Heights is a strong and tight-knit community.  Residents put down roots here and enjoy the vibrant street life with their neighbors at cafes, and on stoops. ",
        "Coogan's is a pub deeply tied to the neighborhood.  Regulars include hospital workers from Columbia University Medical Center, runners from the Armory Track, and local old-timers. ",
        "Washington Heights is one of the hilliest areas in the city.  Many of its streets feature stairways — step stairs — to help pedestrians scale the steep inclines. ",
        "You can't outdo Washington Heights' spectacular views of the George Washington Bridge. ",
        "Washington Heights is far from the center of Manhattan: Convincing friends to visit may be a challenge. ",
        "Real estate prices in Washington Heights have traditionally been some of the lowest in Manhattan, but in recent years the neighborhood has seen resale value rapidly appreciate. ",
        "Fort Tryon Park, home of The Cloisters, offers fantastic views of the George Washington Bridge spanning the Hudson River and the cliffs of the New Jersey Palisades. Broadway is a hodgepodge of fast-food restaurants, bodegas, budget stores, and neon lights.  West 187th Street is another vibrant retail strip further north in Hudson Heights. Fort Washington is the highest point in the city, where Washington tried (and failed) to hold off the British during the Revolutionary War. Washington Heights is a tight-knit community where residents know their neighbors.  Block parties, street markets, and hanging out on stoops are a fact of life. Although it's removed from the action of Downtown Manhattan, Washington Heights provides enough character and local culture to make residents want to put down lasting roots. "

    "west village": [
        "West Village is a neighborhood in New York City, New York with a population of 34,539. West Village is in New York County and is one of the best places to live in New York. Living in West Village offers residents a dense urban feel and most residents rent their homes. In West Village there are a lot of bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and parks. Many young professionals live in West Village and residents tend to be liberal. The public schools in West Village are above average.",
        "I don't know that many people in my area, but most have a liberal agenda to so far left that they are off the map.  It's pretty progressive here in this neck of the woods, even the public schools here are hands on and so highly desired there is a waiting list.",
        "In the winter it's not great, but it's the northeast and it gets cold.  Luckily New York City has effective snowplows that get the job done fairly quickly.  As for potholes it's an issue because there are a lot of older streets in the area, many of which are cobble stone and they can cave in a bit as they were originally made for the weight of horses and carriages not cars and delivery trucks.  In the summer it can get really really hot because of the sidewalks and pollution from stores nearby and buildings the heat can feel like its radiating from every direction, the sun, concrete below and stores, dresses and shorts are helpful.",
        "Driving in the New York City is not recommended there is a lot of traffic, especially going cross town and parking on the street is pretty much a nightmare.  That being said the village is really great to walk in the streets are more narrow than most so if there are big tour groups going by it can be a little annoying to pass through and there is the occasional remnants of dog poop on the street, but it is New York and you will probably find that anywhere.  Biking is made very accessible in this area with at least 4 bike share stations in a 10 block radius that I can think of on the spot, also many of the streets have been renovated to create more space for a bike lane which is helpful.  The downsides are the small streets, traffic and parking.  Also cars don't always pay attention to the bike lanes especially if there is traffic and one lane.",
        "Most of the jobs available in the area are retail or food related.  There aren't office buildings.  Most people work in other parts of Manhattan that live here, probably Midtown or Tribeca and have to commute.  Otherwise I would say most people end up freelancing because there are a lot of successful artists and actors that live here and in that case there are some great cafes like Grounded and 11th St. that are fairly quiet and have great wifi that people can work on if they need a break from their apartment.",
        "A lot of people have been moving into the community from outside of new york and even outside of the country.  The rents are some of the most expensive in the city, many old timers that are here are only able to live here because they have rent control.  The community isn't as strong as it once was, but thats mostly because the people moving in work all the time in order to afford rent or they buy a place as a city home and live in California.  There are lots of dogs in the area though and by the river and in Washington Square park there are dog runs, so I would say over all fairly friendly.  In some of the rental's the landlords do ask for people to not have pets, but most people own or are in a condo or co-op here I would say so it's not an issue.",
        "The new families moving in tend to be very health conscious because they have children, so there aren't many smokers.  In fact a health food store is moving in on my block which is representative of the food choices people care about in the neighborhood.  There are also numerous yoga studios and luxury gyms that many people utilize as well as the citi bikes and the hudson river park trails there are endless options for exercise.",
        "The local governments are obsessed with tourism and spending money to bring in tourism.  This neighborhood ends up getting lots of government attention because it is such a tourist attraction and the residents are fairly wealthy.  However the police aren't always that receptive to calls and don't always come quickly.",
        "I have lived here my whole life and have always felt very safe.",
        "There is not much crime in the area, the police precinct is a few blocks away from where I live.  In all the years I have lived here the biggest crimes have been robbery's because the neighborhood does have a lot of wealthy residents that go away to other houses for vacation and leave their apartments unattended or drunk crimes, such as noise complaints.  The public intoxication crimes that sometimes cause vandalism etc. effect me directly because a bar called Automatic Slims is on my block, my guess is for other people it might not be as much of an issue as most streets are residential only.",
        "Amazing neighborhood, however you are mostly paying for the location as most apartments are really small.",
        "Beautiful residential neighborhood!! Right next to Chelsea and Meatpacking, and super close to SoHo.",
        "Really wonderful place to grow up, but definitely becoming more gentrified/losing its character. The Meatpacking District has become a very popular area for young partygoers and tourists, which has made the area a lot more expensive. Bleecker Street is now all high end boutiques. Still, there are good schools, playgrounds, and it's overall very safe, so it's a good place for children. The Whitney and smaller pop up galleries mean there is always something to see or do, and it is very accessible by a multitude of trains. More diverse in food than in people or income.",
        "By far the best neighborhood I've ever lived in.",
        "What I like most about New York City is the walkability and the abundance of things to do, free events, and educational as well as career opportunities.",
        "The West Village is such an incredible neighborhood to live and grow up in.  It has changed a lot over the years, the only downside is it's rising costs that make it almost impossible to rent in.  However that being said there is lots of things to do and some of the best Italian Restaurants in the city are located in the area.  NYU is nearby so there is a great influx of students and the New School also has a few buildings in the area so there is a huge emphasis on the arts.  The neighborhood also has a great history and is integral to the beginnings of New York.  In the warm weather the Hudson river is a great place to be, and there are lots of little parks to sit in, boutiques to shop at and cafes to meet friends at or do some quiet reading.  It's a community and although there are lots of wealthy non- New Yorkers moving in there is still a local newspaper and government of old timers with rent control that aren't going anywhere until they die.  A great place to be just wish it was much more affordable.",
        "I put okay because if you live in this neighborhood and are lucky to live in a brownstone then your life is much easier.  Otherwise many of the apartments in the area are very old and because the neighborhood is so desired landlords have renovated them to half the size to create more studios and make the building more profitable.  Rent is outrageous here and if I have a couple million to throw down on a brownstone or condo they are worth it, in a great area and they are fairly large also charming.",
        "The food in this area is amazing there is a little bit of EVERYTHING.  There are food trucks, diners, delis, bodega's, five star eatery's, celebrity chef restaurants, and almost every cuisine a person could think of.  The only downside is it can be expensive if you don't know where to go.  Upside is almost anywhere you go will be delicious and the restaurants are all clean.",
        "New York City is the not place to move to if you want mountains and parks and general greenery.  There is central park and prospect park, but those both require a trip on the subway to get to.  The parks department has put in a lot of money to redo the Hudson River Park and piers and they have put in a lot of plant and grassy areas, however most of the grass is fake as it's easier to upkeep and these spots in the summer do get extremely crowded.  This area is better than most though because of the close proximity to the river parks.  The beaches are not that great Coney Island is pretty dirty and ALWAYS crowded, Rockaway in Queens is better but it sure is a trek to get to.",
        "For all entertainment or luxury needs this neighborhood has got you covered.  Restaurants and boutiques and retail especially.  West 4th street and Hudson st for food and Bleeker st has most of peoples needs for retail.",
        "This neighborhood is a HUGE attraction for tourists, it's close to the meatpacking district where all the fashionable bars and restaurants like pastis are and an easy walk to the Chelsea market as well.  In the west village NYU makes it's home which draws students from all nationalities and they hold many events in Washington Square park available to the public.  There are also a few libraries that host movie nights and poetry circles.  Restaurants are everywhere and some of the most highly rated on Zagat are here.  It's also historical and many streets have cobble stones reminiscent of an old new york, and many streets are also not on the grid so many tourists end up getting lost, hopefully they are able to find a village native to point them in the right direction because I've even encountered native new yorkers get lost in the area if they are unfamiliar.  The parks department also hosts a lot of concert events during the summer and programs for children in the winter.",
        "i just renewed my lease on feb 1 for two years funny thing is my landlord inquired about my interest in a buyout since my unit it rent stabilized in the west village through dec/jan i was like `` there's no way i'm doing a buyout right now'' would have been very convenient had i taken that offer now i have n't been at my apt for almost 4 weeks now so i get what you mean for you i would definitely go for a month-to-month agreement it seems like we have to see how things improve or worsen with each week and this will give you the flexibility you need good luck",

        "you're laboring under two related assumptions that are n't accurate the first is that manhattan is more expensive ; which is n't true the second is that manhattan is more culturally desirable and that living in brooklyn is therefore a cost-conscious compromise as the amount of money people are willing to pay to live in brooklyn suggests that's not true either i'm in turn going to assume that your image of both boroughs excludes the still-gentrifying northernmost parts of manhattan and the distant suburban neighborhoods of brooklyn where our parents used to go visit their grandmothers -- the parts no out-of-towner is talking about when they think of manhattan® -- bright lights big city -- or brooklyn™ darling of hipsters the world over so knowing only that you're young and that you're affluent but not rich enough for the west village the most likely thing is that you'll be happier in brooklyn the neighborhoods are prettier the cocktails better the restaurants buzzier the grocery stores more gourmet the liquor stores more likely to stock natural wine unless you have a bro's taste for loud shitty bars and would live in like nashville if they actually had an economy there in which case live downtown",

        "ive lived in la and paris before and i have to say apartments in new york are extremely pricy in comparison to size and area west village is nice and if you like art chelsea/ meat packing would also be ideal if you ’ re looking for a studio it will be tiny maybe 90 sq feet for at least 3,000 a month minimum and you ’ re not going to be getting green space you will luckily have a lot of grocery stores and bars around you just considering how densely packed the city is so that is good honestly anywhere in manhattan is equally nice/ expensive unless you start going up towards harlem which will start to get cheaper i would really suggest staying out of east harlem as it ’ s quite dangerous but west harlem is nice now but i ’ d suggest that if you do end up looking that far out brooklyn would be better if you have the money for that getting a place in say williamsburg would get you an equally nice spot with about twice the space and honestly a shorter commute youd just cross the bridge a couple stops you ’ d also end up with more green space around you honestly brooklyn is really popular and the young people will go party out there i ’ d say a much more popular crowd if you ’ re in your 20s- mid 30s",

let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you ’ d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you ’ d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you ’ d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have",

        "One of New York's most beloved and desirable neighborhoods, the West Village is full of charming streets, great food, and trendy nightlife.",
        "The West Village is technically part of Greenwich Village, but most residents treat them as two distinct areas. The West Village is the slightly calmer, more exclusive, celeb-heavy part of the neighborhood. In fact, as you walk down its charming tree-lined streets of brick townhomes and brownstones, with the occasional café or restaurant tucked in, you'd be forgiven for thinking you weren't in a bustling city of 8.5 million people. But it ain't cheap to get that small town, close-knit community vibe – this is one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the city.<br> This area has a wealth of great restaurants for all budgets and some iconic nightlife venues, including the Village Vanguard jazz club, which opened in 1935; the White Horse Tavern, a 1950s literary favorite; and the Stonewall Inn, which was the birthplace of the gay rights movement in America. You'll also find unique boutiques, book stores, clothing accessories, and jewelry stores.<br> The West Village is bordered on the north by Chelsea, on the east by Greenwich Village, on the south by SoHo, and on the west by the Hudson River.",
        "The West Village is the perfect neighborhood for people who like the finer things in life — think lovely window boxes, well-curated bookshops, and sophisticated company — but without the fuss or ostentation. ",
        "Picture a romantic comedy set in New York City: The heroine invariably lives in a cozy walk-up on a cobblestone street in a neighborhood with cute boutiques and trendy cafes on every corner.  This movie is set in the West Village.  In reality, the West Village is just as picturesque: The neighborhood is tucked between Greenwich Village and the Hudson River and is one of the quietest and most sophisticated pockets of Downtown Manhattan.  Primarily residential, with a distinct lack of office buildings, the leafy, off-the-grid streets are peaceful during the day but get livelier at night.  That's when well-heeled residents, fashionistas, and literati can all be found mingling over oysters at the area's many low-lit cocktail bars. ",
        "There's a quiet beauty to the West Village, and to the people who frequent it.  There's nothing forced or artificial about it — its beauty is perfectly natural. ",
        "West 4th Street curves through the heart of the West Village and is home to many local joints, like the Corner Bistro, as well as some of its loveliest houses. ",
        "The West Village is one of the few Manhattan neighborhoods that completely defies the grid street system.  The blocks are incredibly curvy and difficult to navigate!",
        "From the cobblestone streets in the morning to the Hudson River Greenway at sunset, lovely scenery surrounds the neighborhood. ",
        "The housing stock in the West Village is primarily historic townhouses and walk-ups.  While the exteriors have charm, the interiors are often old and outdated. ",
        "The West Village is one of the most sought-after neighborhoods in the city, which makes it a very expensive and very competitive market.  Mint-condition townhouses and condos easily command several million.  Rentals are also pricey, but are often small and older. ",
        "Formerly known as “Little Bohemia,” the West Village boasts classic artist's lofts and walk-ups in red brick townhouses.  It has a quaint, small-town vibe.  The Corner Bistro is a neighborhood institution.  The dark wood, paneled bar and dining room are packed every night for happy hour drinks and some of the best burgers in town.  Popular with people of means and A-list celebrities, the West Village is easily accessible by public transportation but remains more sedate than neighboring Greenwich Village.  People flock to the West Village to take in the beautiful scenery and the beautiful people.  The neighborhood comes alive at night.  Newer high rises line the Hudson River, where residents are treated to magnificent views of the Statue of Liberty and the New Jersey skyline. "

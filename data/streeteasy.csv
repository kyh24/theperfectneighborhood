15,Lower East Side,https://streeteasy.com/neighborhoods/lower-east-side/,The Lower East Side is an authentic New York City neighborhood in the realest sense. There is nothing polished or polite about it and its chaotic energy appeals to anyone who thrives on late nights and a live-and-let-live lifestyle.,"The narrow streets of the Lower East Side were once lined with tenement buildings, shirt factories and bialy shops.

Locals love Roosevelt Island’s quiet charm and quixotic character.","Roosevelt Island is an anomaly among New York City neighborhoods, and that's exactly its charm. It's centrally located and isolated at the same time. The buildings themselves are architecturally homogenous, but residents hail from all countries and backgrounds. The island is just a stone's throw from the throngs of 57th Street but has just one commercial strip. And though it has changed over time, it has always felt outside the orbit of normal city life. Throughout the 19th century, the island was principally occupied by hospitals. In the 1970s, it became a testing ground for new urban ideals and was redeveloped into a planned residential community, which explains those uniform brick high-rises and winding walkways. Roosevelt Island's earliest residents were looking for a quiet, simple slice of life within city limits. That appeal still holds today, even as new developments have risen and the Cornell Tech Campus looms over the southern part of the island.","Roosevelt Island has an undeniably sleepy, small-town vibe. There's only a single road bridge, no traffic lights, and little parking. The sounds of honking horns and sirens are rare.","While it's not at the center of things, Four Freedoms Park, which spans the southernmost tip of Roosevelt Island, is a popular destination for residents, students, and tourists.","Roosevelt Island has no shortage of quirks, but the ruins of the Smallpox Hospital are certainly unique.

The great schools, convenient parks, water views, little league - residents have convenient access to everything that once drove them to the suburbs, especially if they have kids. But this is not a suburb, it's NYC with all the great stuff the city offers.  If you work downtown, the commute is convenient.  If you work anywhere in the city, most subway lines are a quick walk.  The Brookfield area and World Trade Center center frequently open top restaurants and stores  - then there is also the Tribeca, Seaport, Stone Street and Batter Park - all within walking distance.  The new Governors Island Park is becoming a real draw.  Public schools are nothing short of incredible.  PS 276 and PS 89 run through 8th grade.  #1 US High School, Stuyvesant, is located in BPC.  There is also an excellent select High School, Millennium High School, located in the Financial District, which gives preference to below-canal street residents. The risk and fear is the explosive growth of this neighborhood causing unknown impact.  For now, and likely some time to come, it's an absolutely awesome place to live, and so exciting.",

I like that several subway lines converge in the part of the city providing easy and quick access to anywhere else. There is a bit of tourism but nothing bothersome. Attractions in the area are the South Street Seaport, Stone Street restaurants/bars/pubs, Trinity Church, The World Trade Center & Oculus, and Battery Park.

Most of the events in the community have come to an end years ago, due to the fact that our community center was shut down. Neighborhood trips and block parties were all established within the community center administration. I don't like the fact that we don't have a dog park because almost of us have pets. Some people are afraid of dogs so it would be useful to have an isolated area where pets can be walked and play. I also believe less loitering and trespassing would occur if NYCHA had security in building lobbies.",

It's in close proximity to all major public transportation routes: Port Authority, Penn Station, ACE/7 Trains, Bolt Bus; it is also in walking distance to the mecca of shopping in Manhattan: Hudson Yards, Herald Square, Times Square etc. There are lots of restaurants in the area, however my only critique is that there aren't enough vegan / vegetarian restaurants. There is only one supermarket in the area that I use called Brooklyn Fair. Though expensive, their selection is robust-- they also have the friendliest staff I have ever encountered. The area is quite loud, but living in Manhattan you can not expect any thing less. I always feel safe in my neighborhood, plus there is a precinct in the area on 35th and 9th avenue, so no worries on that front. With the opening of Hudson Yards and the extension of the Highline, the area's traffic will pick up a bit, however it's not overwhelming. Generally a great area to live in.",

I have had the same kitchen cabinets in my apartment for over 30 years, and they will not replace it because they claim there aren't any new cabinets available. cost of housing is cheap because  rent is dependent on your income. In this particular housing project, we do not have to pay for electricity or water. We do however have to pay for each air conditioner in the household. All housing projects are the worst areas to reside in, they are polluted with poverty and drugs and thus crime.

Being located near the Empire State Building, it is a fight to get home walking along 34th Street (any adjacent street, too) is nearly impossible. Often times I find myself walking in the street. The housing availability is also abysmal. I do not often see rentals available because the neighborhood is more business-oriented. On the plus side, commuting is easy because it is a stone's throw from nearly all the main subway lines. You have several restaurants around. Shopping is made easy because you are near several shops on 34th. \n\nWhile it's a nice place to live if you are commuter heavy, if given another choice I'd move.",

I love the area, I really do - there's shopping, good food available, and the park is right across the street. great for families with kids and pets, but also perfectly suitable for a lone wolf. I'd say the only drawback is the increasing homeless problem...we have our \"regular\" homeless, but they've gotten rowdier in recent months. Also, the pedicab drivers and bike rental salespeople are the most annoying, invasive people on the planet - and they're EVERYWHERE. on every corner, begging you to come with them and take a pedicab ride or rent a bike. That leads to another big drawback - the tourists. They, too, are everywhere. I hate tourists,so it definitely gets to me. I try to hang around outside towards the evening, when most tourists and pop-up salesmen are gone, and it's emptier, quieter, and an overall much nicer area. At the end of the day though, these are very minor things in the scheme of it all. It's really a wonderful area, and I think I'd still live here if I could do it all over again - it's just so accessible and so full of life and rich with culture - it is very, very New York, in the best way possible.",

Murray Hill is very much a young professional's neighborhood, filled with 20-30 something year olds who moved here after college (such as myself). The neighborhood is filled with less quirky characters and a lot more happy hour specials. Though a tad more serious and toned down than the downtown neighborhoods, there is nevertheless a good selection of restaurants and bars, and not as quiet at night as areas like the Financial District or Upper East Side.",

Biking is made very accessible in this area with at least 4 bike share stations in a 10 block radius that I can think of on the spot, also many of the streets have been renovated to create more space for a bike lane which is helpful.  The downsides are the small streets, traffic and parking.  Also cars don't always pay attention to the bike lanes especially if there is traffic and one lane.",

There are lots of dogs in the area though and by the river and in Washington Square park there are dog runs, so I would say over all fairly friendly.

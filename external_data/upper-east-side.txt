That the Upper East Side is No. 1 should come as no surprise, given the concentration of wealth found along the westernmost border of the neighborhood (i.e., Museum Mile and the Gold Coast)

wealthiest New Yorkers live? It’s not hard to guess the neighborhoods with the highest concentration of super-duper-rich residents, but the Census Bureau's American Community Survey offers concrete data.
So with that in mind, what are the richest neighborhoods in New York City? If you were going to guess that most of them are in Manhattan, you would be correct—here are the top 10:

access to Central Park, Carl Schurtz, etc - great for runners or people with dogs! (as far as I know) the cheapest neighborhood in Manhattan for recently graduated students to move good bar scene, especially around 2nd Avenue, nice choice of grocery stores (plus can get to Target/Aldi/Costco fairly quickly on the M15), it's fairly quiet at night (unless you live on 2nd), while still being relatively safe, close to the library and some of the best museums! (or maybe I'm a dork)

long commute if you don't live close to Lex, the 6 train on weekdays. IS. HELL., restaurants aren't as plentiful/cheap as they are downtown, and they don't stay open as late, increasing property prices near the new subway line

My boyfriend and I are pretty quiet and don't treasure living among a lot of other young people, so overall I wouldn't move anywhere else in Manhattan. If I were going to move, I certainly would check out Hoboken though! ;)

Nice buildings. Walking past Christian Louboutin every day. Safe Access to museums, central park You can meet entertaining old people.

Crowded 456 train Tourists at certain hours, although less so than UWS Overpriced mediocre food

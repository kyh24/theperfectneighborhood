Compared to the quaint enclave in the city that is Greenwich Village, Hell’s Kitchen feels more urban jungle, but development in and around the neighborhood makes it increasingly family-friendly. (Although admittedly, navigating the more tourist-filled streets of the area with a stroller can be a challenge.) 

With its proximity to Times Square, it’s obviously a good spot for fans of theater, but beyond Broadway, the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and Theater Row on 42nd Street often host shows for kids. The Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum is at 46th and the Hudson River, and the neighborhood’s green space is De Witt Clinton Park, which has numerous athletic fields, a playground, a dog run and more.  The area also has a community garden that has been operating since 1978. 

The mega-development Hudson Yards, which debuted earlier this year, essentially brought a manufactured luxury neighborhood to the immediate south of Hell’s Kitchen, an area previously largely industrial. Amenity-heavy buildings are going up on the far West Side of the neighborhood; a recent Localize.city analysis found that more than 40 percent of Hell’s Kitchen homes for sale are in buildings with private pools. 

Hell’s Kitchen is another District 2 neighborhood, although a popular elementary school in the neighborhood is P.S. 212, which admits children from throughout the district via lottery. Adams sees many parents electing to send children to G&T programs outside the neighborhood, but Aranow identifies schools such as P.S. 51 and P.S. 111 as exciting schools with strong communities and programs (P.S. 51, in particular, is known for its arts curriculum).

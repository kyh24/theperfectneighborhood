Compared to the quaint enclave in the city that is Greenwich Village, Hell’s Kitchen feels more urban jungle, but development in and around the neighborhood makes it increasingly family-friendly. (Although admittedly, navigating the more tourist-filled streets of the area with a stroller can be a challenge.) 

With its proximity to Times Square, it’s obviously a good spot for fans of theater, but beyond Broadway, the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and Theater Row on 42nd Street often host shows for kids. The Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum is at 46th and the Hudson River, and the neighborhood’s green space is De Witt Clinton Park, which has numerous athletic fields, a playground, a dog run and more.  The area also has a community garden that has been operating since 1978. 

The mega-development Hudson Yards, which debuted earlier this year, essentially brought a manufactured luxury neighborhood to the immediate south of Hell’s Kitchen, an area previously largely industrial. Amenity-heavy buildings are going up on the far West Side of the neighborhood; a recent Localize.city analysis found that more than 40 percent of Hell’s Kitchen homes for sale are in buildings with private pools. 

Hell’s Kitchen is another District 2 neighborhood, although a popular elementary school in the neighborhood is P.S. 212, which admits children from throughout the district via lottery. Adams sees many parents electing to send children to G&T programs outside the neighborhood, but Aranow identifies schools such as P.S. 51 and P.S. 111 as exciting schools with strong communities and programs (P.S. 51, in particular, is known for its arts curriculum).

Beautiful area, one of the (surprisingly) most affordable places in lower Manhattan. Great restaurants around every corner and close to all the big broadway theaters. Downside is, your closest/best trains are Times Square, which means dealing with that mess every day, even if you're just trying to get groceries. Also if you walk too far south you're guaranteed to be harassed by all the vagrants hanging out outside port authority.

Hell’s Kitchen is an awesome neighborhood. Take a stroll and take in the architecture, or go on an around the world food trip. There is so much to see and do, that you could spend multiple days and eating and exploring in this neighborhood alone! Spanning from 59th-34th and 8th Avenue west to the Hudson River, known for its plethora of restaurants, Hell’s Kitchen will leave your tummies happy.

So, let’s talk about food first! There are so many places to choose from, and virtually any cuisine you desire. From BBQ, to Thai, to French, to American classics you can’t go wrong. Room Service is some of the best Thai in the city, and if you want some good old fashioned BBQ try out Daisy Mae’s or Southern Hospitality. One of our favorite Mexican food spots is El Original because they are one of the few spots in the city that serve queso! Another all time favorite spot, Meatball Shop, has a location in Hell’s Kitchen. Don’t forget about Gotham West Market if you want a full sampling of foods!
If it’s just a snack you are looking for, pick up a cookie at Schmackary’s, or maybe some fresh bread and bakery items at Amy’s Bread!
 
For nightlife head to Flaming Saddles for a for sure good time, or Hudson Terrace for a little more of a lighthearted night out with friends.
 
Head on over to the river to experience the Intrepid Museum, or wave at the cruise ships as they take off!
If you want to stay in Hell’s Kitchen look no further than The Hudson, Yotel, or the Skyline Hotel. Ash and I have stayed at the Hudson and had an incredible experience. It’s a bit hidden, so make sure you look for the iconic trees that sit outside the entrance.

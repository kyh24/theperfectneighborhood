It’s hard to find a New York neighborhood with more urban charm than Greenwich Village, a cozy area of landmarked and leafy winding streets lined with low-rise brownstones. It’s also hard to find a place where a family can live: The neighborhood’s median asking price for a three bedroom, two bath is the same as Tribeca’s at $6,995,000, but there are just 41 for sale. (The median rent is an eye-popping $16,225 a three-bedroom apartment.)

Aside from the picturesque environs, The Village is home to community gathering place and informal performance venue Washington Square Park (which has a playground, dog run, large central fountain, and iconic Washington Square Arch), and Union Square and its playground are not far away. The presence of New York University is (for better or for worse) felt strongly here; the school does put on lots of family-friendly events and programming. NYU’s Skirball Center frequently stages shows for young audiences, and films of all kinds can be caught at the Angelika Film Center and the IFC Film Center & Cafe. 

Yet another neighborhood in District 2, Greenwich Village is home to strong elementary schools, including P.S. 41, P.S. 3, and P.S. 340, the last of which was opened in 2014 to help alleviate overcrowding at P.S. 41.

Stuyvesant Town is more than just a residential development, it's a community. Stuy-Town contains over 89 buildings and 8,757 apartments that along with Peter Cooper Village is home to over 25,000 people. Originally built to relieve housing shortages and provide homes for returning veterans, the 80-acre complex is covered in beautiful red brick apartment buildings with parks and playgrounds throughout.

The neighborhood has an almost suburban feeling to it, making it a family-friendly area that has reasonable prices. The community is self-sufficient, with its own security force and newspaper. Stuyvesant Town is conveniently located near the Flatiron District and Lower East Side with access to multiple bus routes and subway lines despite its suburban-like qualities.

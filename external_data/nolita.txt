Nolita, or “North of Little Italy,” is a neighborhood in lower Manhattan bounded by Houston Street in the north, the Bowery on the east, Broome Street on the south, and Lafayette Street on the west. Once considered a part of nearby Little Italy, Nolita NYC is now considered its own entity with a distinct vibe composed of trendy, hip New Yorkers who flock to the area’s high-end luxury shops, boutiques, bars, and restaurants.

History
Many Manhattan neighborhoods follow a similar template; timeless, classic, and steeped in culture and rich history. That’s not necessarily the case with Nolita NYC. The neighborhood is like the indie, angsty teen of Manhattan, seemingly changing its look and feel as trends change. 

Its current personality is a relatively new phenomenon. The area was part of Little Italy as recently as the 1950s, and until the 1980s it was known as one of the tougher areas in Manhattan. Def Jam Records was headquartered in the neighborhood back then, and Martin Scorsese used the hardened area where he grew up as the inspiration and backdrop for a number of his gritty movies including, Mean Streets.  

An influx of professionals and artistic-types in the late 1980s and early 1990s helped the neighborhood begin its metamorphosis into the lively hub of luxury shopping and leisure that it is today.

Accessibility

Nolita NYC provides great access to public transit. The Spring Street stop gives you access to the 4 and 6 trains, the Prince Street stop gives access to the N and R, and the Broadway-Lafayette Street stop provides access to the B, D, F, and M trains.

Lifestyle

Moby, Vanessa Carlton, and John Mayer all call the Nolita neighborhood home. While you’re out shopping for the best in streetwear or a unique boutique piece on Lafayette Street at Supreme, WeSC, Carhartt, Diamond Supply Co., Scotch and Soda, or DNA Footwear, keep your eyes peeled for the starlets.

Restaurants

The offspring of traditional, Italian cuisine and an adopter of modern, hip fare, Nolita NYC is home to some of the most delicious locales in Manhattan. Consider Lombardi’s if you’re looking for a classic Italian pizza or Chefs Club if you’re looking for something a bit more upscale and luxurious. There’s also a bunch of bars in the area including Sweet & Vicious, Mother’s Ruin, and Spring Lounge. 

Cost

Bearing a much closer similarity to SoHo than its former parent neighborhood Little Italy, real estate prices in NoliTa NYC are high due to the premium location and availability of properties. The median sales price for a property is $2,920,000 and the median rent is $3,800/mo.

Final Verdict
There’s not much hidden about this “hidden gem” anymore, but this is still one of our top locations to live in for shopping, restaurants, and bars. It’s a great central location for all that lower Manhattan has to offer, and a great neighborhood in its own right, if a bit pricey.

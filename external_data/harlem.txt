Harlem is a big area, and you’ll find different features and character (and in some cases, school districts) in the neighborhoods of West, Central, and East Harlem. But overall, the neighborhood is home to numerous large apartments, going for fewer dollars (in some cases, significantly). As our recurring townhouse picks show, it’s also an area where, if you have your heart set on living in a brownstone, this type of housing stock is more affordable than other parts of the city. 

To the west, there is Riverbank State Park, a 28-acre, multi-level complex with an Olympic-size pool, carousel, playgrounds, skating rinks, and more. More central is St. Nicholas Park, where a playground was recently renovated. The northern part of Central Park includes the man-made lake, Harlem Meer, a wildlife habitat and popular spot for catch-and-release fishing; the Charles A. Dana Discovery Center, which holds programming and events, and Lasker Rink and pool. Central Harlem also has Marcus Garvey Park, where the rec center is slated for renovation. And to the East, Thomas Jefferson Park is an active community hub, with a new skate park, playgrounds, a pool, track, and rec center. Finally, on the far north end, there is Jackie Robinson Park, slated to see major improvements by 2020. 

Cultural institutions include the Apollo Theater, and to the south, El Museo del Barrio and the Museum of the City of New York. Both museums run family-friendly exhibits and programming. The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, part of the New York Public Library system, was recently upgraded and holds a wide range of events, while the northern Macomb’s Bridge Library is moving to a larger, improved facility. Of course, the New York Yankees play just across the river in the Bronx. 

Three school districts cover Harlem: Northern part of District 3, District 4 (East Harlem) and District 5 (West Harlem). High performing schools in the area include public unzoned schools Central Park East 1 and Central Park East 2, with priority given first to families in District 4, and then District 5. Aranow cites District Five’s P.S. 125 as an up-and-comer, and many families opt for charter schools in the area, including Success Academy, KIPP Infinity, and Harlem Village Academy. For private school, there is Harlem Academy, which has a sliding scale tuition, and the usual suspects on the Upper West and East Sides and to the north in Riverdale.

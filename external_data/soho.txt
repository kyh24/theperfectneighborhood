wealthiest New Yorkers live? It’s not hard to guess the neighborhoods with the highest concentration of super-duper-rich residents, but the Census Bureau's American Community Survey offers concrete data.
So with that in mind, what are the richest neighborhoods in New York City? If you were going to guess that most of them are in Manhattan, you would be correct—here are the top 10:

Ditto Tribeca/Soho coming in at No. 2, given the recent influx of pricey developments—residences like celeb magnet 443 Greenwich Street, or the ultra-luxurious 70 Vestry—that have brought wealthier residents to the neighborhood.

History of SoHo
SoHo, short for “South of Houston Street”, is a district in downtown Manhattan widely known for its variety of shops and stores ranging from designer boutiques to trendy retail chain stores. Its elegant cast-iron architecture and cobblestone streets make it the perfect neighborhood for those looking to fulfill their dream of living in the Big Apple. But before SoHo came to be what it is today, it was a completely different world.

Prior to becoming a collection of iron-clad buildings, SoHo used to be a lush green farmland. By the early 19th century, the area had been urbanized and transformed into a prosperous neighborhood. SoHo rapidly developed and it became increasingly middle class with more businesses moving to the neighborhood.

Today, SoHo is one of the top shopping destinations in New York City. Although the area has been modernized, the buildings and streets still remind us of its history and make the area a charming place to live.

The Vibe of SoHo


Did you know that SoHo has the world’s largest collection of cast-iron buildings? The idea of cast-iron architecture became widely popular during the industrial revolution due to the fact that it has many advantages over wood and masonry.

Today, SoHo’s loft-style apartments, historic cast-iron architecture, and cobbled streets give the neighborhood a unique touch and make the vibe both classic and modern.

Unique Features of SoHo
SoHo’s most unique feature is its architectural buildings and cobbled style streets. Triplemint agent, Kemba Buchanan describes SoHo as “the stomping grounds for all things cool, chic, and trendy, and a scene where street style, people watching, and beautiful architecture collide.”

Because of the unique look of the neighborhood, many Instagrammers and producers will do photoshoots and film on the streets of SoHo. You might even find yourself bumping into a celebrity!

SoHo is also near some of the most popular neighborhoods in NYC. Chinatown, Little Italy and the East Village are all close by, so you’ll never run out of things to do or places to explore!

Every global powerhouse has a neighborhood that's just a little bit trendier than all of the rest (Saint-Honoré, oui?). In New York City, that neighborhood is SoHo. Named for its location just SOuth of HOuston street, SoHo features cobble-stone streets lined with fashion boutiques, cafes, and art galleries. Be warned though, fashion comes at a price, and in SoHo that means some of the most expensive rents in the City.

In the the sections below, you'll get a glimpse into life in SoHo. But before you go anywhere, make sure you scroll through the photos in the gallery below. Nothing can tell the story of a neighborhood as well as a few good photos. 

For most New Yorkers, SoHo is the ultimate shopping destination. But for the lucky ones who live here, it's also a neighborhood of historic buildings, spacious lofts, cobblestone streets, and adorable little eateries. It's an iconic place, partly because of its famous transition from artists' haven to residence for the rich and famous; and also because of its cool-infused nickname (short for "south of Houston"). In both respects, it started a trend that plenty of other Manhattan and Brooklyn neighborhoods have since followed.

SoHo's crowds and most of its stores are centered on Broadway, which is bursting with flagship stores and stylish chains. Sidewalk vendors get in on the action too, setting up tables of scarves, sunglasses, and jewelry. A little further off the main drag, you'll find boutiques selling off-the-runway fashions by most of New York's famous designers.

It's this off-the-beaten-path (off-Broadway) part of the neighborhood where you'll find most of its charm and a much calmer vibe. Cobblestone streets are still common here, and most of the buildings are included in a historic district distinguished by its cast-iron facades. Especially after the stores close, the area can be beautiful and serene.

There's a sprinkling of restaurants throughout, including tiny neighborhood coffee shops where the owner might just know your name. And the owner of the luxury pet-grooming salon definitely knows your Yorkie's name. Many SoHo businesses off of the main shopping strip cater to a wealthy clientele, as rents here are not for bargain seekers. But despite being a place for the rich and chic, the neighborhood has managed to maintain a laid-back vibe.

Besides fashion, SoHo is famous for art. Once a major hub for artists, the neighborhood is still home to some galleries and performance spaces, although most have moved to Chelsea or other neighborhoods. Many of the apartments housed in the historic cast-iron buildings are spacious lofts once occupied by artists, before the full gentrification of the neighborhood played out (and still occupied by the super-successful ones).

Nowadays, young to middle-aged couples and stylish people of all ages live in SoHo. Besides the iconic cast-iron-facade lofts, other architectural gems such as brick townhouses can be found as well. Most buildings don't rise above six floors, although some taller apartment buildings have made their way in, especially west of 6th Avenue.

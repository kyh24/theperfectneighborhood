wealthiest New Yorkers live? It’s not hard to guess the neighborhoods with the highest concentration of super-duper-rich residents, but the Census Bureau's American Community Survey offers concrete data.
So with that in mind, what are the richest neighborhoods in New York City? If you were going to guess that most of them are in Manhattan, you would be correct—here are the top 10:

Ditto Tribeca/Soho coming in at No. 2, given the recent influx of pricey developments—residences like celeb magnet 443 Greenwich Street, or the ultra-luxurious 70 Vestry—that have brought wealthier residents to the neighborhood.

History of SoHo
SoHo, short for “South of Houston Street”, is a district in downtown Manhattan widely known for its variety of shops and stores ranging from designer boutiques to trendy retail chain stores. Its elegant cast-iron architecture and cobblestone streets make it the perfect neighborhood for those looking to fulfill their dream of living in the Big Apple. But before SoHo came to be what it is today, it was a completely different world.

Prior to becoming a collection of iron-clad buildings, SoHo used to be a lush green farmland. By the early 19th century, the area had been urbanized and transformed into a prosperous neighborhood. SoHo rapidly developed and it became increasingly middle class with more businesses moving to the neighborhood.

Today, SoHo is one of the top shopping destinations in New York City. Although the area has been modernized, the buildings and streets still remind us of its history and make the area a charming place to live.

The Vibe of SoHo


Did you know that SoHo has the world’s largest collection of cast-iron buildings? The idea of cast-iron architecture became widely popular during the industrial revolution due to the fact that it has many advantages over wood and masonry.

Today, SoHo’s loft-style apartments, historic cast-iron architecture, and cobbled streets give the neighborhood a unique touch and make the vibe both classic and modern.

Unique Features of SoHo
SoHo’s most unique feature is its architectural buildings and cobbled style streets. Triplemint agent, Kemba Buchanan describes SoHo as “the stomping grounds for all things cool, chic, and trendy, and a scene where street style, people watching, and beautiful architecture collide.”

Because of the unique look of the neighborhood, many Instagrammers and producers will do photoshoots and film on the streets of SoHo. You might even find yourself bumping into a celebrity!

SoHo is also near some of the most popular neighborhoods in NYC. Chinatown, Little Italy and the East Village are all close by, so you’ll never run out of things to do or places to explore!

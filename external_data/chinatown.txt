In both Chinatown and Little Italy, much of the housing consists of historic tenement buildings. But many of these apartments have been renovated in recent years, so they are a far cry from the shared, cramped quarters they once were. The neighborhood's newest residents favor large loft apartments converted from factory floors and warehouses. And, mixed in with the historic buildings, there is also some new construction, including luxury condos and doorman buildings.

As evidenced by the shiny new buildings, Chinatown and Little Italy are becoming a trendy area to live among young professionals who want to be near the action of downtown. Both ethnic neighborhoods have been undergoing change for a while, but still have very distinct vibes that set them apart from their beyond-hip neighbors, the Lower East Side and SoHo.

Chinatown, on the other hand, is a sprawling neighborhood that is marked by Chinese and Southeast Asian businesses in a large radius around its official perimeters. It's both a home and a destination for much of the city's Asian population, as it's packed with grocery stores, restaurants, cultural organizations, and other businesses useful to the Chinese American community.

On Canal Street and Mott Street, many storefronts cater to tourists and other non-Chinatown-residents. These arteries are often packed with crowds on the weekends and for events like Lunar New Year celebrations. But beyond the obvious dim sum restaurants and trinket shops, the neighborhood has quite a lot of other activity going on.

Children and the elderly gather in parks to play, dance, and sing; the intellectually curious check out the newly redesigned Museum of Chinese in America; young people look for fun at trendy bars or bubble tea shops; foodies descend upon noodle and dumpling hotspots; and artsy types throw loft parties.

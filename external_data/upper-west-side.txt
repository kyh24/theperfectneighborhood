While not as tony as the Upper East Side (which could be a good, or a bad thing, depending on your perspective), the Upper West is similar to its crosstown counterpart in many ways. It has, of course, Central Park, home to the Diana Ross Playground at 81st Street, and Heckscher Playground at the south end. To the west is scenic Riverside Park, which runs the length of the neighborhood, and has the popular family spot Hippo Playground. 

While the popular Riverside Skate Park at West 109th Street is currently off-limits for reconstruction, Localize.city reports that it’s expected to reopen by 2020 with a new design deemed “world class” by local skaters and will accommodate skaters of all ages and abilities. 

Localize.city also notes the debut this fall of accessible features at St. Gregory’s Playground and Bloomingdale Playground. Bloomingdale, for instance, will have ramps to play structures, handicapped swings, quiet sensory spaces, adjustable height basketball hoops, and gender-neutral bathrooms. 

The American Museum of Natural History is an Upper West Side gem, and you’ll also find The Children’s Museum of Manhattan, the New-York Historical Society (home to a separate museum dedicated to a young audience, and frequent host of kid-friendly exhibits) and performing arts complex Lincoln Center, which in addition to favorites like The Nutcracker, stages an entire series of top-notch children’s productions for all ages. The Marlene Meyerson JCC is another popular community resource, providing fitness facilities, classes, and events. 

Apparently, the Upper West Side likes family-friendly festivities: Localize.city reveals that of all the neighborhoods in the city, this area holds the most block parties on Halloween, as indicated by the number of permits filed. 

The Upper West Side has its fair share of elite private schools, such as The Calhoun School, Collegiate School, Trinity School, and Ethical Culture School. Popular public schools include P.S. 199, P.S. 87, and P.S. 9, as well as The Anderson School, which is a citywide highly-selective gifted and talented school to which 50 kindergartners are admitted each year (out of approximately 15,000 students who take the G&T test). District 3 underwent rezoning in 2017 to reduce overcrowding and improve diversity, so it’s unlikely another rezoning will happen any time soon.

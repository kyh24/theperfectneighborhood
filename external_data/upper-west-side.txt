While not as tony as the Upper East Side (which could be a good, or a bad thing, depending on your perspective), the Upper West is similar to its crosstown counterpart in many ways. It has, of course, Central Park, home to the Diana Ross Playground at 81st Street, and Heckscher Playground at the south end. To the west is scenic Riverside Park, which runs the length of the neighborhood, and has the popular family spot Hippo Playground. 

While the popular Riverside Skate Park at West 109th Street is currently off-limits for reconstruction, Localize.city reports that it’s expected to reopen by 2020 with a new design deemed “world class” by local skaters and will accommodate skaters of all ages and abilities. 

Localize.city also notes the debut this fall of accessible features at St. Gregory’s Playground and Bloomingdale Playground. Bloomingdale, for instance, will have ramps to play structures, handicapped swings, quiet sensory spaces, adjustable height basketball hoops, and gender-neutral bathrooms. 

The American Museum of Natural History is an Upper West Side gem, and you’ll also find The Children’s Museum of Manhattan, the New-York Historical Society (home to a separate museum dedicated to a young audience, and frequent host of kid-friendly exhibits) and performing arts complex Lincoln Center, which in addition to favorites like The Nutcracker, stages an entire series of top-notch children’s productions for all ages. The Marlene Meyerson JCC is another popular community resource, providing fitness facilities, classes, and events. 

Apparently, the Upper West Side likes family-friendly festivities: Localize.city reveals that of all the neighborhoods in the city, this area holds the most block parties on Halloween, as indicated by the number of permits filed. 

The Upper West Side has its fair share of elite private schools, such as The Calhoun School, Collegiate School, Trinity School, and Ethical Culture School. Popular public schools include P.S. 199, P.S. 87, and P.S. 9, as well as The Anderson School, which is a citywide highly-selective gifted and talented school to which 50 kindergartners are admitted each year (out of approximately 15,000 students who take the G&T test). District 3 underwent rezoning in 2017 to reduce overcrowding and improve diversity, so it’s unlikely another rezoning will happen any time soon.

The Upper West Side embodies a classic spirit of Manhattan that you can get a feel for by watching back-to-back reruns of Seinfeld. The retro diners, Jewish delis, and native New Yorkers still have a presence, but just as many newcomers and young professionals are in the mix. A safe neighborhood that's sandwiched between Central Park and Riverside Park, it has become especially popular among families with young children.

Besides the parks, the neighborhood is defined by its cultural institutions, most notably Lincoln Center, a complex of world-famous performing arts venues for ballet, opera, film, jazz, and classical music. This hub, along with other destinations such as the American Museum of Natural History, the New York Historical Society, the Beacon Theatre, and Symphony Space, plus nearby Columbia University, has made the Upper West Side a go-to spot for the intellectually curious and seekers of sophisticated culture, as well as a home for many who work in the arts and academic fields.

Because of its intellectual and cultural roots, the Upper West Side is known for its liberal penchant, especially when compared with the Upper East Side, its more conservative counterpart across Central Park.

In terms of housing, the Upper West Side offers a range of brownstones, walk-up apartment buildings, and high-rises with doormen. Buildings closer to Central Park West and Riverside Drive are noticeably fancier and pricier than those in the middle of the neighborhood, since they have a quieter residential ambiance and immediate access to green space. The inner corridor, however, offers greater convenience in terms of proximity to businesses.

Broadway runs through the core of the neighborhood and is bustling with restaurants and shopping, of both the chain and boutique variety. The tourist hotspots around 59th Street (Columbus Circle), 66th Street (Lincoln Center), and 81st Street (the Natural History Museum) naturally attract more chain businesses.

The Upper West Side is notable for its traditional Jewish delis, bagel shops, and food markets, including the legendary Zabar's. Nowadays the culinary scene is almost as diverse as the city itself, and during warmer months the sidewalks thrive with outdoor seating for brunch and dinner. There are a good number of bars catering to young people as well as an older clientele, but overall the neighborhood has a wholesome, family-friendly feel.

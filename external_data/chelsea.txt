Offering a vibe that’s a little more relaxed and funky than the Upper East and West, Chelsea draws families with its high-performing schools (the neighborhood is also in District 2), parks and facilities, and cultural hot spots. 

P.S. 33 is known for having strong general ed and G&T programs, as does P.S. 11. (Localize.city notes that the latter has grappled with efforts to bolster the school’s diversity.) Neighborhood private school Friends Seminary, which is for grades K through 12, is the oldest continually co-ed school in the city. Chelsea is home to one of the most expensive private schools in the city, Avenues, and Adams notes that another popular area school is Success Academy Union Square, a charter school.

The neighborhood is a mix of activity and cute, quiet streets to the west, with a diverse array of parks that include The Highline, Hudson River Park, and Chelsea Waterside Park, the last of which recently received a major makeover.  

Localize.city reports that more open space will be added to the area in the coming years with the development of Pier 55, a privately funded project expected to open in 2021 with gardens and an amphitheater, and Pier 57, which is being redeveloped from a former sanitation facility into an open space.

For more activities for kids and adults, there’s Chelsea Piers, an enormous facility with a toddler gym, ice rink, bowling alley, gymnastics space. It hosts camps, classes, and birthday parties. The Whitney Museum of American Art is just south of the neighborhood, and The Rubin Museum of Art, which holds family days and a popular annual street fest, is at its heart. The area’s shopping options are a nice mix of chic and interesting (Chelsea Market is home to food vendors and upscale retail), and amazing to have nearby when you’re a parent. Also in the area: Trader Joe’s, Old Navy, Buy Buy Baby, and Michael’s.) The popular Union Square Farmers Market, with an adjacent popular playground, is also nearby.

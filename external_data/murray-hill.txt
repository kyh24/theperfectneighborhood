Formerly home to the City’s affluent during the late 1800s and early 1900s, Murray Hill offers plenty to attract those interested in NYC’s dining and nightlife scenes. The neighborhood is also a boon for culture lovers.

The neighborhoods feature a mix of architecture from high-rise apartments to office buildings to historic townhouses. You’ll also find plenty of restaurants, shops, and bars – both those that cater to recent grads and those of the more gentile variety.

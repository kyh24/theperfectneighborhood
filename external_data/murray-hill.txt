~3-5 blocks from Herald Sq subways and Grand Central/33rd st 6, Quiet at night, Quick walk to Madison Sq Park/Gramercy/Flatiron. Good access to all parts of the city. Gingerman and Rattle & Hum close by.

Not many good restaurants in immediate walking distance, mostly just take out spots or places like Cask which entirely mediocre for the price., No neighborhood feel.

Formerly home to the City’s affluent during the late 1800s and early 1900s, Murray Hill offers plenty to attract those interested in NYC’s dining and nightlife scenes. The neighborhood is also a boon for culture lovers. On these streets, lined with prewar townhouses and Beaux-Arts mansions, you can find the Morgan Library & Museum, gifting the City with an enormous collection of rare books; and the sleek, modernist Scandinavia House, which holds an art gallery and frequent concerts and lectures.

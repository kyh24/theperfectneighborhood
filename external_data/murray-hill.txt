~3-5 blocks from Herald Sq subways and Grand Central/33rd st 6, Quiet at night, Quick walk to Madison Sq Park/Gramercy/Flatiron. Good access to all parts of the city. Gingerman and Rattle & Hum close by.

Not many good restaurants in immediate walking distance, mostly just take out spots or places like Cask which entirely mediocre for the price., No neighborhood feel.

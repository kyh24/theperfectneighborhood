Neighborhoody feel, Still not fully gentrified, so it feels less sterile than other manhattan neighborhoods to me, Great restaurants with many types of cuisines, Cool shopping, Thriving bar scene, including some of the best cocktail bars in the city, General lack of tourists

Bad subway access (but served by buses and the L train), Overpriced, old housing. Not many affordable buildings with amenities, Not much green space, except some small community gardens and Tompkins Sq Park, Loud

Nightlife is awesome. It's a major hotspot for not only shopping, but if you want to meet friends it's a popular place. Rarely had to travel far to go out for the night, which is good because unless you're near fourteenth street the only train around is the F, which is annoying. It's also expensive as hell, I ended up moving because I realized I was paying so much in rent I couldn't even enjoy the nightlife around me.

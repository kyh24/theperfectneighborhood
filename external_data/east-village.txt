Neighborhoody feel, Still not fully gentrified, so it feels less sterile than other manhattan neighborhoods to me, Great restaurants with many types of cuisines, Cool shopping, Thriving bar scene, including some of the best cocktail bars in the city, General lack of tourists

Bad subway access (but served by buses and the L train), Overpriced, old housing. Not many affordable buildings with amenities, Not much green space, except some small community gardens and Tompkins Sq Park, Loud

Nightlife is awesome. It's a major hotspot for not only shopping, but if you want to meet friends it's a popular place. Rarely had to travel far to go out for the night, which is good because unless you're near fourteenth street the only train around is the F, which is annoying. It's also expensive as hell, I ended up moving because I realized I was paying so much in rent I couldn't even enjoy the nightlife around me.

History of the East Village
Today’s East Village stretches from the East River to Third Avenue (east to west) and from East Houston Street to 14th Street (south to north). In the early 17th century, most of the area was a farm owned by Dutch Governor Peter Stuyvesant. However, by the early 19th century, it had become part of the growing city and was home to many immigrants from Europe.

After World War II, the tenement apartments and vibrant international community began to attract students, political activists, artists, and musicians.

The neighborhood became the epicenter of counterculture in New York City, home to artists like Allen Ginsberg and Andy Warhol, and was an incubator for avant-garde theater and the New York punk scene.

The past of the East Village shaped what the community is today – an exciting neighborhood with a lively nightlife that is the definition of downtown living.

The Vibe of the East Village


New developments in the East Village are relatively rare, but many older buildings are being remodeled to offer contemporary conveniences and polish. This trend has increased demand, but the East Village is still an affordable alternative to pricey neighboring areas.

If you’re looking for value, there are many pre-war walkups in the East Village to consider, especially as you search farther east.

Convenient access to the subway, ferries, and buses makes getting in and out of the neighborhood easy and affordable. It’s also bike-friendly, with plenty of Citi Bike stations and dedicated bike lanes.

Unique Features of the East Village
During the day, the East Village may seem like just a quiet neighborhood. However, once the sun sets and the stars come out, the area becomes packed because of the abundance of bars and restaurants to explore.

Although the neighborhood’s rough edges have been somewhat smoothed as time progressed, the birthplace of the American punk scene still has character. You can stroll down the street and find an old-school dive bar or avant-garde performance art in a low-key venue.

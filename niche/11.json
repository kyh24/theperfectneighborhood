It's in close proximity to all major public transportation routes: Port Authority, Penn Station, ACE/7 Trains, Bolt Bus; it is also in walking distance to the mecca of shopping in Manhattan: Hudson Yards, Herald Square, Times Square etc. There are lots of restaurants in the area, however my only critique is that there aren't enough vegan / vegetarian restaurants. There is only one supermarket in the area that I use called Brooklyn Fair. Though expensive, their selection is robust-- they also have the friendliest staff I have ever encountered. The area is quite loud, but living in Manhattan you can not expect any thing less. I always feel safe in my neighborhood, plus there is a precinct in the area on 35th and 9th avenue, so no worries on that front. With the opening of Hudson Yards and the extension of the Highline, the area's traffic will pick up a bit, however it's not overwhelming. Generally a great area to live in.",

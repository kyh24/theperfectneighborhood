I didn't find anything of this caliber unless the apartment was significantly smaller and 50% more expensive. The apartment was literally SPOTLESS when I moved in. I couldn't find a spec of dust inside any of the kitchen cupboards. My place has ebony floors (old school, stunning parquet) and the modern trim package - plus some upgrades like custom closets, a Wolf Range, built in refrigerator and dishwasher. The leasing team, Henrietta and Ecaterina were delightful. The welcome center - I think Jacob and Edith have been superb and the maintenance staff even offered to help break down my boxes for recycling. Everyone here wants you to have an amazing experience. I'm seriously just waiting for them to tell me that it was an accident and that my rent is 50% more than I'm paying - it's THAT NICE. WOW.",

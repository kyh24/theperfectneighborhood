            "text": "When we moved to Battery Park City in the 1990s, the area was a ghost town on nights and weekends.  Today, it's one of the best places in NYC, if not the US, to raise kids.  The great schools, convenient parks, water views, little league - residents have convenient access to everything that once drove them to the suburbs, especially if they have kids. But this is not a suburb, it's NYC with all the great stuff the city offers.  If you work downtown, the commute is convenient.  If you work anywhere in the city, most subway lines are a quick walk.  The Brookfield area and World Trade Center center frequently open top restaurants and stores  - then there is also the Tribeca, Seaport, Stone Street and Batter Park - all within walking distance.  The new Governors Island Park is becoming a real draw.  Public schools are nothing short of incredible.  PS 276 and PS 89 run through 8th grade.  #1 US High School, Stuyvesant, is located in BPC.  There is also an excellent select High School, Millennium High School, located in the Financial District, which gives preference to below-canal street residents. The risk and fear is the explosive growth of this neighborhood causing unknown impact.  For now, and likely some time to come, it's an absolutely awesome place to live, and so exciting.",

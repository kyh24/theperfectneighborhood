Since the start of the summer there have been several murders, rapes, robberies, and gang violence. I avoid walking outside alone during the night, I avoid certain areas, and if for whatever reason I have to be outside at night, I am always talking to someone on the phone and updating them about my whereabouts. At night the police tend to stay in one area. I don't feel like the police would get to me in time in the event of an emergency because many of the buildings in my neighborhood look the same, and the police tend to get lost. For instance, a few years ago I called 911 because my infant niece was choking. The police and ambulance arrived 20-25 min later and told us they got lost. Unfortunately, since then I don't trust that they will get to me or anyone else in time.",

I have had the same kitchen cabinets in my apartment for over 30 years, and they will not replace it because they claim there aren't any new cabinets available. cost of housing is cheap because  rent is dependent on your income. In this particular housing project, we do not have to pay for electricity or water. We do however have to pay for each air conditioner in the household.

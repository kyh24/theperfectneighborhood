amount of power without being beholden to city residents construction of the bridge would have decimated battery park and required the demolition of castle clinton for an on-ramp many city politicians including laguardia were vocal opponents of the plan but moses kept arguing that a bridge would be far less expensive to build than a tunnel which was n't true in the least the plan was approved by the city planning commission and would have been built had it not been nixed by henry woodring the secretary of war woodring argued that the bridge would impede access to the brooklyn navy yard never mind that there were three bridges downriver already and blocked all federal funding to the project unless a tunnel was built instead construction commenced on the brooklyn-battery tunnel in 1940. out

saying they loved the place also saw some people saying the walls are paper thin : / the other thing is being in bpc i'm not super close to the subway it's about a .25 mile walk down chambers across the west side highway to me that seems a bit far in terms of distance to the subway in manhattan but maybe i'm being unrealistic is this distance also going to limit me in terms of food delivery

need to manage your expectations here ... chelsea and tribeca are incredibly expensive areas and you wo n't find these things in those areas upper west side is somewhat doable but you need to be thinking in a more flexible frame of mind you can find most of what you want but this city is very much a city that you get what you pay for so tacking on requirements is going to make your search tougher you can find a pretty good sized kitchen but again it's going to be a good sized kitchen for nyc not huge overall big enough for two people is doable in unit laundry is something that costs significantly extra here so i would not insist on this you may be able to find something you like with it but it's rare at $ 4000 and below 700sqft is definitely doable i saw someone else suggest a doorman and that again is something that will cost money and you will give something up for in return no matter what neighborhood you end up is going to be incredibly safe so you really do n't need to be concerned about safety i am a real estate agent who was born and raised here and have lived almost my entire life here i would suggest the following neighborhoods to find the best results and are

past saturday's nyc beer week kickoff event for those of you who did n't know the event features beer exclusively from breweries within nys this year the event was split into two sessions each aboard a ship which left from pier 36 on the east side and which sailed to the statue of liberty i was on the latter ship - the view of the city and the statue at sundown was phenomenal **review : ** first thing's first - last year's event was indoors this meant a lot more space and noticeably there were some breweries absent off the top of my head transmitter threes upstate newburgh captain lawrence dyckman and ommegang were absent this year while they were present last year however there was still plenty of beer to be had the surprise of the event was jonas bronck whose chocolate egg cream stout vaulted towards the top of my favorite chocolate stouts brooklyn showed up big time with their improved old fashioned which tastes ... like a really good old fashioned - in beer form chelsea's black hole xxx stout was very very good speaking of chelsea their former head brewer is the current head brewer of gun hill brewing co. and his anti-imperialist russian imperial stout was also phenomenal i think gun hill is making some of the best stouts in ny another surprise for me was keg & lantern as i've had nothing from them both hot gold chili beer and gastronomical ipa were very very good offerings i'd chime in on finback but i just love them too too much i did n't drink oscillation 003 at the event only because i have it in my fridge finback is maybe an inch behind other half as claiming the title for my favorite personally the best brewery in ny crossroads also surprised again having had nothing from them previously with a very solid ipa outrage and a very solid stout black rock the most unique beer was definitely gina by birreria eataly - a pale ale dry hopped with thyme as i told the rep it tasted like liquid focaccia bread anyway that's a short sweet review there was

homeless guy's rent for the next 2.5 months i need help finding him a job hey all tl ; dr : i made friends with a homeless guy and got him an apartment i told him i'd pay for his food and lodgings till february but he needs to get a job past then i'm looking for leads i made friends with a homeless guy i passed every day on the way to work he was always reading so we talked about books and the long & short of it is we became friends given his intelligence and relative equanimity i did n't think it made any sense that he was on the street so i asked him how he'd got stuck there he told me his side of his story which was pretty tragic and which i believed i asked him why he could n't get a job and the answer he gave me basically was that he spent all his energy surviving homelessness there were a large number of practicalities which he just could n't see to in his current condition and which kept him from making and carrying out any long-term plans for instance he could n't figure out how to get a bank account to get paid into he had one set of dirty clothes -- getting and keeping more than that was very difficult given how regularly he was stolen from getting an address was a big problem for all sorts of reasons there are all these little things which get much harder when you've lived off the grid a few years and much much harder when you're seriously depressed to boot as winter started getting serious it bugged me to high hell that he'd be out on the streets i put myself in his shoes and i realized that it would n't take too many winters outside in new york to ruin me beyond hope of recovery to a normal healthy mental state i did n't want that to happen to him it felt like a stupid stupid waste for this nice intelligent guy to be spending all his energy dodging cops to sleep in construction sites and other homeless people trying to steal his shit rather than working at some bodega or even desk job somewhere reading books and drinking coffee in his off time and minding his own business when i see a guy on the street covered in shit and piss begging for nickels i feel bad but i know that there is nothing i can really do beyond ease his suffering for a night at most with my friend i felt differently : if he could just have a warm place to stay and a bit of support there was a real chance he could become a regular person like anyone else he could have an apartment a job a girlfriend friends maybe even a family some day or without support he could suffer in vain through life on the street drawn downwards and downwards every day and who knows how many winters he'd remain intact before the streets of the city finally broke him to pieces at some point i decided i would pay his rent through the winter i could afford it and he needed it and its what my conscience told me to do i ca n't convince anyone reading this to accept my trust of this guy or his story all i'll say is i've never been a sucker and i'm not a sucker now and i believe him if you think i'm getting played i understand but please do n't try to convince me of it i'm not interested in wasting my energy on thinking about that i consulted my skepticism already i'm past that at this point i do n't think he's lying and if he is n't then what he needs right now is an ally not a doubter getting him on his feet is a project i've written down a figure specifying the amount i'm willing to put into this project and i consider that money already gone all that's important is that i do what i can to help this dude out with the resources i've allocated to the task in mid-november we got him set up in a room in chelsea which was affordable enough for me to feel okay about since then i've been trying to get him back on the grid and looking for work with some success he's got a cell-phone now we'll be trying to set up a bank account in the next few days and thanks to his veteran status we've got him set up with a pro-bono lawyer to help handle any liens which might be levied against him from unpaid medical bills accrued during his time in the street i'm going to try to get him to go to the doctor and the dentist i can help him with all of this because i've got google and a phone and a bit of energy but the most important single thing is that he get a job and i am not sure how to help him with that the basic problem is that i do n't know what the job market looks like from his perspective i work a white-collar 9-5 and i've never worked any other kind of position else more or less i just do n't know where a guy in his situation should be looking for employment i'm wondering if anyone has any ideas or advice or leads some positive qualities of his : 1. he's a voracious and careful reader 2. he's very personable and socially intelligent 3. his teeth are pretty fucked up but he's not bad on the eyes 4. he seems remarkably trustworthy and decent one of the reasons we became friends in the first place 5. if it gives him any points in your book he's a veteran i ca n't speak to his work ethic because i do n't know him in that capacity but my impression is he's very eager to rejoin the working world okay that's my spiel if you have any leads or have any advice for where this guy can get work reply here or send me a dm also if you know a decent place for him to live that finds his lack of references / recent past acceptable dm me he's

*before* i start answering your questions : check out /r/nyc and /r/asknyc - both are far more active than this subreddit also check out both subs faq's for lots of great visiting nyc suggestions : 1. i would suggest youth hostels it looks like you can get a bed in a dorm for $ 55- $ 60/night the hosteling international and chelsea international hostel are the two best-known but there are many more hostels will be least expensive option plus they will generally be full of other students to meet and have fun with regarding your equipment i would n't assume that a hostel has safe storage - call ahead and ask if they ca n't provide safe storage is it possible that columbia can provide some secure storage for you 2. lodging in other boros than manhattan brooklyn queens maybe hoboken or jersey city could be less expensive although not that much less expensive you have to balance the location with what you want to do if you want to explore nyc nightlife you probably want to stay in manhattan if you are not a night owl and want to just see the sights during the day then the long subway ride out to the outer boros might make sense i'd lean towards staying in manhattan if you can though 3. are you asking about an mta metrocard if yes then a week pass usually makes sense it can be used on the subway and on busses if you are talking about a different pass please elaborate 4. not sure what express routes you are referring to - can you elaborate 5. take the path train it's easy cheap and relatively quick it is a separate system from the mta so you will probably need to buy separate tickets for this trip path info here : 6 amtrak trains are your best bet going between those two train stations the cheapest seats i see are $ 75 one way for a 3-hour trip in the middle of the night if you want to travel during the day the cheapest seats i see are around $ 100 one way flights nyc to baltimore are less expensive - they start at $ 135 round trip the flight is only an hour although once you get to/from the airport and leave in time for airport security the total travel time is about the same you can get to/from all the nyc airports and bwi airport baltimore via public transportation it looks like that is only on weekdays on the baltimore end though i like www.kayak.com for finding airfare i also want to add that most of the tourist attractions in nyc are very

seem much newer - proximity to central park i \u2019 m a runner - good bar/restaraunt scene from what i understand for reference i am a single early 30s straight guy i am willing to spend up to 4500

apartments is no fun i work in real estate so i've used my experience plus the most recent advice posts on r/nycapartments to create this small q & a for people moving this winter : **first question most people ask -** where do i live which is the safest neighborhood where are the cheapest apartments - let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you \u2019 d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you \u2019 d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you \u2019 d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have"], "chinatown": ["hong kong supermarket in

honest then go to time square to look at some tourist stuff you then can pretty much skip midtown macy's flat iron building etc and head to washington square park by nyu more tourist stuff and some food around in the village or go to chinatown/little italy for food after that go to world trade / wall street / bull and see statue of liberty from manhattan if you want to go up to the world trade

around a bit go back down 5th ave all the way to 42nd walk west to times square past the library lions then i'd get back on the train at 42nd and take the 1 to go down to south ferry ride the ferry back and forth then walk up broadway to the wtc through the financial district and see trinity church and the 9/11 memorial after that i'd either go to washington square park chinatown or just right to the brooklyn bridge and cross over to bk for food if you end up in brooklyn you can take the g north to queens plaza transfer to the e to jackson heights and take the q70 back into the airport i've done almost this exact route with my visiting friends it's a long day but fun : edit to add- you'll save a lot of money by using the subway especially crossing from the outer boroughs into manhattan the trains are fast and easy i recommend the citymapper app for plotting your next move edit again to add another idea- take the m60 bus from lga into the city it's really fast i'd say get off at 125th/st nicholas ave. get a good look at harlem from the bus it's pretty cool looking the bus goes through queens and over the bridge gets a good look at manhattan from uptown which is cool and cuts through historical parts of harlem i'm a fan get on the b or c down to 81st/natural history museum or 72nd get off and walk though central park down to that same south east corner i was talking about by the zoo that's a nice pretty walk if you start at 72nd you can see strawberry fields and 81st has the museum which is a really neat building then walk down 5th to 42nd for times square and do the

comedy cellar in west village a number of times and they've enjoyed it also check out upright citizen's brigade if you prefer improv instead of standup some other random ideas : walk through chinatown

1959 or something and guess what viruses are a part of life they might even predate life itself if you agree that viruses are not actually alive but are more like the `` missing link'' precursors to life insofar as the all plants and animals that have ever lived and do still live have what appears to be viral dna in literally every single cell ... some forty to fifty-seven percent of the human body is not actually human at all but composed of all kinds of microorganisms and that's just on the inside ; outside every inch is covered in billions of other microorganisms literally all the fuckin time ... i read this sub for info but it's devolved mostly to a bitch-fest among sanctimonious scolds jealous of others masking their own fears as high-minded civic responsibility i'm an essential

throughout the day no masks no gloves no sanitizers and you know what that's fuckin life i'd have expected better in 2020 but at least it's not say 1492 or something ... it's just crazy how people are losing their shit over this -- i actually have to laugh and do laugh at people all the time who give me the evil eye for not going along with their new state-sponsored religion of panic ... just today i got the evil masked eye from some dog-walkers in the park for being unmasked and smiling while listening to my portable bluetooth speaker `` turn turn turn'' by the byrds was on appropriately enough i thought ... it's really mass hysteria and quite funny that people are freaking out over this i laughed at that crazy woman once'cause she was giving the evil eye while i stifled an innocent cough throat simply felt extremely dry at the moment ; i swallow air while biking like how whales filter water while swimming i guess and it has an effect sometimes and it's just nonstop nonsense altering

are no bike lanes but it's very wide and not super busy on the uws central park west is good for going uptown and columbus ave for getting downtown \\- harlem is pretty hilly especially going east to

\u2019 ll be okay there \u2019 s in general a cross-street that offers an east or west bike lane every 10 or so blocks often less google maps cycling directions are actually great for this - they \u2019 ll route you using bike lanes whenever possible i highly suggest as you \u2019 re starting out and in general never going against traffic - i.e don \u2019 t ride north on 5th ave etc pedestrians cyclists and drivers tend to not look in those directions in terms of safety cyclists get a very bad rap from pedestrians and drivers alike keep that in mind and be cautious citibike is a great starter but if you end up riding your own bike get lights and reflectors for it and while it \u2019 s not the law wear a helmet you \u2019 ll never end up regretting it", "seeing some good advice here so far here's mine not in any particular order : -be wary of any taxi and rideshare vehicles or any black car with tlc plates especially suv's they will dive across the bike lane to turn or right into the bike lane to pickup/dropoff -be wary of ebike delivery guys they ride recklessly without care for anyone - they will run up on you to pass without warning come the wrong way up the bike lane whip around corners without looking shoot through gaps and clip you on their way by -stay well away from any commercial vehicles - panel vans box trucks but especially private carting services they will kill you and keep going -turning vehicles are supposed to yield to you when crossing the bike lane but they usually don't -use streets with bikes lanes and take it easy going faster does n't mean you get there faster there is a sweet spot for cruising speed -expect anyone/everyone to step out in front of you be ready to stop not ready to swerve because there may be another cyclist coming up on your other side -please be mindful about how you blow intersections go behind crossing peds not in front -past the 20th of every month the cops are looking to fill their ticket quotas keep an eye out before you take the red light they post up in the uws ues les/east village along the major commuter avenues 1st & 2nd -get one bike to ride for pleasure and one beater to commute on/run errands/lock up use 2 ulocks kryptonite offers insurance/guarantee if you register and always lock up next to a nicer bike and or one that is n't locked as well as yours -you need a bell on your handlebars at all times and lights after sunset/before sunrise to be legal -check out the hudson river greenway it goes along the entire west coast of manhattan and is car-free and very scenic when you're in east harlem check out the harlem river greenway and randal's island", "hi felllow east harlemite randall's island and the triborough bridge are an excellent way for you to get

what people think about it live by myself or find a roommate find place in manhattan or in another borough basically because i work ooo it would be pretty nice to have my own space but at the same time being in a new area and meeting new people would be good albeit rolling the dice a bit but it would be cheaper to get more space with a roommate too thoughts \\*\\*just to add i do n't have a

would be open to brooklyn/queens would love advice on best safe neighborhoods in any of those areas since we are newbs > our initial requirements are : - at least 700 square feet - laundry on site but realllllly want in-unit laundry - quick commute to dt manhattan in manhattan is the preference - 4k or less a month - want an open kitchen so you need to manage your expectations here ... chelsea and tribeca are incredibly expensive areas and you wo n't find these things in those areas upper west side is somewhat doable but you need to be thinking in a more flexible frame of mind you can find most of what you want but this city is very much a city that you get what you pay for so tacking on requirements is going to make your search tougher you can find a pretty good sized kitchen but again it's going to be a good sized kitchen for nyc not huge overall big enough for two people is doable in unit laundry is something that costs significantly extra here so i would not insist on this you may be able to find something you like with it but it's rare at $ 4000 and below 700sqft is definitely doable i saw someone else suggest a doorman and that again is something that will cost money and you will give something up for in return no matter what neighborhood you end up is going to be incredibly safe so you really do n't need to be concerned about safety i am a real estate agent who was born and raised here and have lived almost my entire life here i would suggest the following neighborhoods to find the best results and are the closest to what you're looking for in a neighborhood : the upper west side the upper east side hell's kitchen kips bay/murray hill and the east village in brooklyn williamsburg park slope cobble hill boerum hill carroll gardens and gowanus those are all great

the first question you will ask is `` do you have a pic'' i'm totally cool with exchanging pics after we've established a dialogue and have gotten to know each other better ** a few things about myself : * i'm quite an easy-going flexible and up-for-anything kind of guy * i'm an activities-oriented person preferably doing something together and cherishing the experience * i'm not really into drinking and do n't smoke however i can drink on occasion for social reasons it's just not my activity of choice * i would consider myself an introverted person but i can definitely open up to someone i trust in i prefer hanging out in one-on-one scenarios or small 2-4 person groups where people can interact and focus on each other well i try to avoid large social gatherings and parties with strangers as they're not my thing * i stay away from social media as much as possible the only thing close to social media that i use is reddit and i try to limit my time on it as well * enjoy live and online comedy last year i saw trevor noah's standup set at new york comedy festival went to ucb improv for the first time and checked out a comedy club in greenwich village you'll frequently find me listening to chris d'elias congratulations podcast or binge watching key & peele clips on youtube * i'm a big fan of art not too long ago visited the biennial and lichtenstein exhibition at the

late show with stephen colbert also been to the jimmy fallon show in the past and other tv show tapings i enjoy these one-off and unique experiences from time to time * enjoy traveling and visited japan netherlands luxembourg and germany in the last year if we hit it off then i'd definitely be looking forward to traveling together in the future * other random events i've attended the past few months are sumo & sushi indoor go-karting alvin ailey dance performance the moth storytelling's shin lim's magic show and art battle nyc just a taste of the different activities i like to take part in and explore * big fan of lesser known and independent movies you'd often see me at the smaller cinemas in town such as angelika ifc center metrograph and east village enjoy all kind of films including foreign and documentaries some movies i've seen recently are parasite a hidden life dark waters marriage story fantastic planet knives out weathering with you uncut gems mishima 1917 the lighthouse

locally and abroad recently attended a bundesliga match in berlin and this year i'm also looking forward to the checking out the world series of darts at msg * used to be a heavy gamer back in the day but do n't have as much time for it anymore nowadays mostly play mobile games on the go but still a big gamer at heart would love if you can bring that out of me once again i enjoy playing multiplayer games with friends i've also been to many esports events in the city over the years including overwatch finals league of legends world finals esl one csgo and dota2 tournaments rocket league finals and so on * heavily into music and live concerts this is a big hobby of mine and i highly enjoy it so i would love it if you do as well or at least willing to give it a try i'm the type of person who'll go to a concert stand in the front and have a good time i've attended too many shows the past couple of years to list but i listen to all types of music already planning to see a few this year some concerts i've been to in the past : * tool * smashing pumpkins * joe hisaishi studio ghibli composer * of montreal * cigarettes after sex * rolling stones * ed sheeran * of monsters and men * the

broadway musicals been to many already but still quite a few i want to see looking forward to seeing sing street soon in short i'm open to anything and everything there's probably a bunch of things that i've missed or forgot to mention but i've written way too much already i can also be a homebody when i'm feeling too tired and can lie in bed all day watching movies and listening to music so do n't let all the outdoors activities scare you i'm willing to try any of the things you enjoy doing as well and partake in your hobbies/interests as much as my own what i'm looking for in a companion : * please be in the nj/nyc area as i'm not keen on starting a long-distance relationship i'm looking for a hangout partner after all as the title suggests i want someone that i can meet up in-person and spend quality time with but also someone to chat and text with casually throughout the day to keep things going ideally i would want our friendship to blossom into something more but there's no rush or pressure * i'm also looking for consistency this is a big deal to me i want someone who will be able to spend time together on a frequent basis not someone who i can only see or chat with once every couple months i know people have their own friends and family and i totally respect and understand that but i want to find someone who will be able to meet up quite often hopefully at least once a week or as our schedules allow that way we can build something meaningful and make a habit of going out and enjoying our time together you only get out of a friendship/relationship as much as you put in i know everyone has their own busy lives and schedules especially in nyc and it feels that people just do n't seem to have time for you but i'm willing to put in the time and effort if you are willing to do it as well so i need to find someone who is eager to meet more than once and keep consistent communication it might sound like i'm a bit clingy but in actuality i just enjoy making a deeper connection with another person through putting in the extra effort and making time for them i'm the type of person who prefers to have a few strong friendships rather than a bunch of meaningless and casual acquaintances * ideally you're somewhere between 18-40. i'm not really picky about age what's more important is that we share some common interests have playful and fun communication but most of all are enthusiastic about being active and getting to know one another and try new things * i'm attracted to cute petite women i'm 5'8'' myself so being the same height or under is ideal if any of this interests you please send me a dm telling me about yourself what you enjoy and anything you'd want me to know certainly willing to meet up for a bubble tea and chat to see where things go thanks for reading : d", "nyc gay bar history `` the mafia and the gays meticulously documents how the mob controlled many gay bars for decades in new york due to their once illicit status and relies upon an extensive collection of primary sources including fbi files many of which were not previously publicly available the gay bars historically were integrated into the mafia rackets for example the establishments often were financed through mob-tied coin-op vendors and their related loan companies jukebox king alfred miniaci funded dozens of gay bars and other joints controlled by the mafia in the 1950s and 1960s including the peppermint lounge miniaci supplied slot machines in the 1930s to frank costello and had dined with the mob boss on the may 2 1957 night he was shot gay bars sometimes served as drug drops forget about the pizza connection ; this was the pansy connection club 82 in new york \u2019 s east village was a popular club with drag revues and in the 1950s also was part of the distribution network in the genovese family \u2019 s heroin trade for which boss vito was convicted in 1959. gay bars were profit centers for all the mafia families among the powerful mobsters who oversaw vast interests in lgbt nightlife were gambino underboss aniello dellacroce genovese capo matty ianniello and colombo underboss sonny franzese the mafia had ties to some of the most iconic gay establishments including the continental baths in the hotel ansonia from 1969 to 1976 on the upper west side which received protection from the colombo family in exchange for installing its vending machines continental owner steve ostrow \u2013 a classically-trained opera singer \u2013 developed such close ties with joe colombo that he was performing *the star\u2013spangled banner* at the june 29 1970 italian-american unity day rally in columbus circle when the mob boss was shot the lgbt community once was married to the mob out of forced necessity but after gay bars became legal the relationship often continued in many establishments out of mutual convenience gay bars no longer were busted simply for homosexual assembly but they still risked raids if serving as sex clubs or drug drops accordingly the mob still had both services to provide and protection to offer particularly during the party decades following the stonewall riots if a bar had a back room for anonymous sex operated afterhours or sold drugs or boys then odds are it was a mafia joint and that involved numerous places during the 1970s and 1980s indeed the mafia hijacked gay liberation for political cover and used so-called auntie gays \u2013 the uncle toms of the gay community \u2013 as frontmen for their bars to evade suspicion the wiseguys allegedly even infiltrated the christopher street liberation day committee and christopher street festival committee which ran new york city \u2019 s gay pride parade and some related events for much of the 1970s and 1980s over the decades there has been a fair number of gay guys in the mob \u2019 s ranks including cross-dressing genovese soldier david petillo who once was a boy prostitute hitman vito arena from roy demeo

warning come the wrong way up the bike lane whip around corners without looking shoot through gaps and clip you on their way by -stay well away from any commercial vehicles - panel vans box trucks but especially private carting services they will kill you and keep going -turning vehicles are supposed to yield to you when crossing the bike lane but they usually don't -use streets with bikes lanes

school in nyc i made plans to live with one of my best friends from high school and college who was going to grad school at columbia i immediately booked a one-way ticket from tampa \u2014 my hometown \u2014 and told my roommate i trusted him completely to choose our new apartment i had no clue where i would be moving ; i was just so excited to make nyc my home my roommate sent me pictures of our future apartment and it was rental love at first sight i told him to sign on the spot the author on moving day after i told my uncle where my apartment was he has lived in nyc for over 30 years ; thus he acts just how you \u2019 d think he ripped me about 50 new assholes \u201c harlem are you crazy \u201d he asked \u201c do you know where that is do you know how dangerous it could be \u201d he wouldn \u2019 t stop making comparisons to my neighborhood and serpico and midnight cowboy and still hasn \u2019 t to this day the very next day he went to my neighborhood met my roommate for the first time and stood on my stoop for hours he walked around the neighborhood he talked to people on my block which i \u2019 m sincerely sad was not taped for my later entertainment he also walked around the neighborhood at night to give my father \u2014 his brother \u2014 a full report after he assured my dad the neighborhood wasn \u2019 t completely terrible but also pointing out the staircase in my building looked just like the one in a crack-den apartment in serpico he made me get mace which i still carry and named himself deputy commissioner of /u/i_keep_it_real_ \u2019 s security tepidly he gave three-fourths of his blessing i flew into jfk weeks later cabbed it to hamilton heights and promptly twirled about our beautiful big apartment carrie-style i went to explore

to cop in harlem/all of my dominicanos right there up on broadway/brought me back to that mcdonald \u2019 s so no my neighborhood is not tribeca but it \u2019 s beautiful and cool in its own right i found my favorite places to eat and walk within time i \u2019 ve seen every ethnicity in my neighborhood : students families and everyone else \u2013 if i feel safe in harlem what is the lingering stigma about harlem that makes people scared for me first frankly it \u2019 s because i \u2019 m not a big black thug second there \u2019 s the crime history third i think harlem makes people think of a lone tumbleweed rolling down a deserted street landing at the door of a shady pawn shop do i feel safe i never haven \u2019 t here \u2019 s why : in new york everyone is crazy in some way \u2014

at in the street \u201c ay mama \u201d sure but it \u2019 s no different than assholes in their first suits from barneys in financial district bars are thinking so it really doesn \u2019 t matter to

other manhattan neighborhoods there are no women on macrobiotic diets dictating to nannies on the sidewalks on the contrary women in my neighborhood let their husbands have it in the middle of the street often wearing tropical-colored get-ups everyone is loony in their own charming way \u2013 there \u2019 s more to my neighborhood than its diversity from a girlish perspective my apartment features crown molding exposed brick and a washer/dryer in my bathroom from a real estate perspective the pre-war architecture of my neighborhood is incredible i don \u2019 t live in a shoebox and the rent is reasonable and from a thug perspective my address lends me a bit of street cred the cashier at my bodega says i keep it real jay-z and frank serpico have probably been here photo by author

vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you \u2019 d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you \u2019 d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you \u2019 d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have"], "financial district": ["yes i live in the financial district $ 3600 for an incredibly well-designed studio full kitchen

me pictures of our future apartment and it was rental love at first sight i told him to sign on the spot the author on moving day after i told my uncle where my apartment was he has lived in nyc for

ave/53rd street cut into central park from the south east corner walk through where the zoo is and look around a bit go back down 5th ave all the way to 42nd walk west to times square past the library lions then i'd get back on the train at 42nd and take the 1 to go down to south ferry ride the ferry back and forth then walk up broadway to the wtc through the financial district and see trinity church and the 9/11 memorial after that i'd either go to washington square park chinatown or just right to the brooklyn bridge and cross over to bk for food if you end up in brooklyn you can take the g north to queens plaza transfer to the e to jackson heights and take the q70 back into the airport i've done almost this exact route with my visiting friends it's a long day but fun : edit to add- you'll save a lot of money by using the subway especially crossing from the outer boroughs into manhattan the trains are fast and easy i recommend the citymapper app for plotting your next move edit again to add another idea- take the m60 bus from lga into the city it's really fast i'd say get off at 125th/st nicholas ave. get a good look at harlem from the bus it's pretty cool looking the bus goes through queens and over the bridge gets a good look at manhattan from uptown which is cool and cuts through historical parts of harlem i'm a fan get on the b or c down to 81st/natural history museum or 72nd get off and walk though central park down to that same south east corner i was talking about by the zoo that's a nice pretty walk if you start at 72nd you can see strawberry fields and

apt/roommates but unsure where to even begin his search diversity in the neighborhood is fine but ideally he would like to connect with a group of young singles with whom he could go out share shabbat

n't know where lots of recent grads may gravitate to that is within an easy commute to world trade center area and has ample restaurants night life etc nor where there might be a greater number of young jewish singles not orthodox - more conservative or reformed and/or any sites or realtors that might help him at least find some jewish roommates to share expenses he is able to spend up to about

everyone music what do you want rock classical rap big acts indie mainstays no names in a bar i will try to give you one nugget of advice though : check the big tourist sites you want to see off your list and then get the hell out of midtown and the financial district and see some neighborhoods where new yorkers live and play if you want an adventure off the typical tourist trot take the 7 line out to flushing corona or jackson heights in queens and get some ethnic food which food who cares they got it all just pick your specialty mexican vietnamese nepalese whatever and google it there will

nothing on it at that time this is according to alice sparberg alexiou's 2010 book `` the flatiron : the new york landmark and the incomparable city that arose with it'' the st. germaine would be the closest match with the hotel you describe so i'd say that your ancestors sold that hotel at least a few years before the civil war started alexiou's book might mention who eno bought the land from

the site of the flatiron building i have in my possession a rather rambling account of my grandmother's mother's side of the family - all of whom were located in nyc for some time there's details i can verify to a point but since i am a not from the city and b not able to get in there and look up information easily - going to ask for help at least if i can get pointed in the right direction to eventually get to the city and do more research my grandmother's unmarried aunt wrote a pages long document that she started in 1962 and carried on rewriting for years after as best i can gather the gist of it is this : maiden aunt's grandmother - margaret molloy - this was her name at birth - she was the youngest of 8 children all had been born in ireland they came over to nyc some time after margaret was born in around 1835 the molloys first worked in then saved and bought a hotel that was supposedly on the site of what is now the flatiron bldg margaret met her first husband there a man called j. mccann who went and got himself killed early in the civil war have not been able to verify this detail yet - but she soon after met henry hyde parker also a widower i gather `` fell in love'' and they then had their first child by 1863. henry parker was a bit of a story himself but eventually was at work as a gold beater perhaps more for a jewelry store on maiden lane and they had a home on 36th st between 5th and 6th avenue no idea what kind of place it was except they had servants they packed up and ran to canada during the draft riots they employed african american servants where my great-great grandfather was born in 1865 - william henry parker - and when they came home in 1866 the whole house was burned down from what the written story tells not sure if there is any

other steak places that are generally lauded minetta tavern st. anselms peter luger's but i like beatrice because it's more interesting/cheffy than those places eataly is a tourist nightmare on the

generally the experience it's a schlep though dominican rotisserie chicken at malecon on 177th is cheap and amazing and probably the most underrated `` cheap eat'' in nyc there's also one on 98th street but the 177th st one is more the expeirence in terms of chinese : xi'an famous food for pretty unique style of chinese food not available in other cities han dynasty for szechuan jing fong or nom wah for dim sum both get crowded on weekends if you can make it to flushing lanzhou hand pulled noodles + dumpling galaxy alternatively the chinatown in sunset park has pretty good food but

know how difficult moving in the winter can be going out there when it's freezing cold to see apartments is no fun i work in real estate so i've used my experience plus the most recent advice posts on r/nycapartments to create this small q & a for people moving this winter : **first question most people ask -** where do i live which is the safest neighborhood where are the cheapest apartments - let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you \u2019 d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you \u2019 d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you \u2019 d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have"], "gramercy": ["is anyone around 14th / 15th st. and 3rd ave and hearing a man screaming and yelling all day this might be

the price i enjoyed the food/style of dishes at the eddy and aquagrill more than those at seeger and blue hill although the vibe at blue hill was awesome food at marea was excellent but i was n't too keen on the atmosphere there either huge loud dining hall other notes : -ideally the place would be in manhattan but would be willing to go to the closer neighborhoods in brooklyn -this one is pretty

\u2014 my hometown \u2014 and told my roommate i trusted him completely to choose our new apartment i had no clue where i would be moving ; i was just so excited to make nyc my home my roommate sent me pictures of our future apartment and it was rental love at first sight i told him to sign on the spot the author on moving day after i told my uncle where my apartment was he has lived in nyc for over 30 years ; thus he acts just how you \u2019 d think he ripped me about 50 new assholes \u201c harlem are you crazy \u201d he asked \u201c do you know where that is do you know how dangerous it could be \u201d he wouldn \u2019 t stop making comparisons to my neighborhood and serpico and midnight cowboy and still hasn \u2019 t to this day the very next day he went to my neighborhood met my roommate for the first time and stood on my stoop for hours he walked around the neighborhood he talked to people on my block which i \u2019 m sincerely sad was not taped for my later entertainment he also walked around the neighborhood at night to give my father \u2014 his brother \u2014 a full report after he assured my dad the neighborhood wasn \u2019 t completely terrible but also pointing out the staircase in my building looked just like the one in a crack-den apartment in serpico he made me get mace which i still carry and named himself deputy commissioner of /u/i_keep_it_real_ \u2019 s security tepidly he gave three-fourths of his blessing i flew into jfk weeks later cabbed it to hamilton heights and promptly twirled about our beautiful big apartment carrie-style i went to explore the neighborhood which wasn \u2019 t scary to me at all it \u2019 s a mostly-dominican neighborhood complete with a mcdonalds that delivers only three blocks from my apartment sure i don \u2019 t live in carrie bradshaw \u2019 s new york but recently i realized that jay-z \u2019 s lyrics from \u201c empire state of mind \u201d are about my hood \u2014 yes that \u2019 s my mcdonald \u2019 s : i used to cop in harlem/all of my dominicanos right there up on broadway/brought me back to that mcdonald \u2019 s so no my neighborhood is not tribeca but it \u2019 s beautiful and cool in its own right i found my favorite places to eat and walk within time i \u2019 ve seen every ethnicity in my neighborhood : students families and everyone else \u2013 if i feel safe in harlem what is the lingering stigma about harlem that makes people scared for me first frankly it \u2019 s because i \u2019 m not a big black thug second there \u2019 s the crime history third i think harlem makes people think of a lone tumbleweed rolling down a deserted street landing at the door of a shady pawn shop do i feel safe i never haven \u2019 t here \u2019 s why : in new york everyone is crazy in some way \u2014 from larry david to michael bloomberg so if you go into any new york neighborhood under the assumption that everyone is crazy you will always have your guard up and your eyes forward do i get whistled at in the street \u201c ay mama \u201d sure but it \u2019 s no different than assholes in their first suits from barneys in financial district bars are thinking so it really doesn \u2019 t matter to me my roommate is muscular and black so when we walk down the street together people assume we \u2019 re just another hip racially mixed couple to not mess with we \u2019 re not he \u2019 s gay i like to pretend we \u2019 re lady gaga and usher taking a stroll just living our lives like my roommate and i harlem is eccentric it \u2019 s an urban norman rockwell painting tucked away next to the hudson river old men play chess on the sidewalks on overturned milk crates my dry cleaning guy waves at me every morning cheerfully sweeping his stoop in a wifebeater and tube socks as opposed to many other manhattan neighborhoods there are no women on macrobiotic diets dictating to nannies on the sidewalks on the contrary women in my neighborhood let their husbands have it in the middle of the street often wearing tropical-colored get-ups everyone is loony in their own charming way \u2013 there \u2019 s more to my neighborhood than its diversity from a girlish perspective my apartment features crown molding exposed brick and a washer/dryer in my bathroom from a real estate perspective the pre-war architecture of my neighborhood is incredible i don \u2019 t live in a shoebox and the rent is reasonable and from a thug perspective my address lends me a bit of street cred the cashier at my bodega says i keep it real jay-z and frank serpico have probably been here photo by author

outside 217 east 22nd street saw this guy crying he must have been in his early 20's maybe really kind looking and decent white kid but he looked like he was in so much pain manhattan being manhattan never stops for anyone unfortunately or fortunately i am quite the opposite how can you cross a person crying and not go to upto them and ask them if they are okay though i was getting late i had to check if he was doing okay so i reached out to him we spoke for a bit he told me it was a personal issue and i did not want to push him so i let the issue be in the 3 minutes or so we might have spoken i just tried to console him i gave him a hug i offered him water i wish i could have done more i do n't know how though by the time i left i made sure he was smiling i just really pray things are okay with him i do n't know why i am sharing this but i think i might feel better have you hlever seen a person crying and you can not forget the pain in there eyes i do n't think i can express it

freezing cold to see apartments is no fun i work in real estate so i've used my experience plus the most recent advice posts on r/nycapartments to create this small q & a for people moving this winter : **first question most people ask -** where do i live which is the safest neighborhood where are the cheapest apartments - let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you \u2019 d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you \u2019 d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you \u2019 d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have"], "greenwich village": ["what is the best and most reliable sushi delivery that you guys know in manhattan we live at greenwich and we been getting some pretty sloppy deliveries from various

recommendations hi everyone - i'm planning to move to nyc and was hoping to get a little advice on the right neighborhood to move into i have read a couple earlier threads on the subject on reddit

career and work from home at this point budget isn \u2019 t really a concern within reason \u2013 i can afford up to 8k a month in rent by the standard nyc 40x rent rule i am mainly looking for the ideal neighborhood on the basis of quality of life issues : primarily night life dating restaurants access to events/activity general cleanliness subway access i guess i'd also prefer the general crowd to be more mid 20s-30s instead of fresh out of college i have seen a lot of recommendations of west village / greenwich village i am strongly considering that area but the apartments are of course often quite old / rough even at a relatively high price point in the village and i \u2019 d tend to prefer more of a modern highrise with a view i was also thinking about chelsea / meatpacking which seems to have some nicer highrise doorman type buildings tribeca looks nice but apparently is pretty dead for a youngish single guy from what i've heard are there other areas you would recommend a lot of nice buildings seem to be in the midtown area but i do n't know if the general craziness and traffic of that area would be worth it from what i can tell uws/ues are probably too slow paced and family oriented to be ideal at this point the lower east side in general seems to be a little less appealing than the west side from most of what i've seen and read - i could certainly be wrong

what i'm looking for in a companion : * please be in the nj/nyc area as i'm not keen on starting a long-distance relationship i'm looking for a hangout partner after all as the title suggests i want someone that i can meet up in-person and spend quality time with but also someone to chat and text with casually throughout the day to keep things going ideally i would want our friendship to blossom into something more but there's no rush or pressure * i'm also looking for consistency this is a big deal to me i want someone who will be able to spend time together on a frequent basis not someone who i can only see or chat with once every couple months i know people have their own friends and family and i totally respect and understand that but i want to find someone who will be able to meet up quite often hopefully at least once a week or as our schedules allow that way we can build something meaningful and make a habit of going out and enjoying our time together you only get out of a friendship/relationship as much as you put in i know everyone has their own busy lives and schedules especially in nyc and it feels that people just do n't seem to have time for you but i'm willing to put in the time and effort if you are willing to do it as well so i need to find someone who is eager to meet more than once and keep consistent communication it might sound like i'm a bit clingy but in actuality i just enjoy making a deeper connection with another person through putting in the extra effort and making time for them i'm the type of person who prefers to have a few strong friendships rather than a bunch of meaningless and casual acquaintances * ideally you're somewhere between 18-40. i'm not really picky about age what's more important is that we share some common interests have playful and fun communication but most of all are enthusiastic about being active and getting to know one another and try new things * i'm attracted to cute petite women i'm 5'8'' myself so being the same height or under is ideal if any of this interests you please send me a dm telling me about yourself what you enjoy and anything you'd want me to know certainly willing to meet

here most of my life i'm also a fiction writer and i do some historical fiction tbh like many have said there's a ton of different neighborhoods you can choose from each with their own distinctive flavor so finding one should be easy i'd recommend making your character from the outer boroughs like the bronx or queens or brooklyn as even back in the sixties manhattan was already on its way to becoming the sort of glamorized cultural landmark it is today-meaning lots of folks from manhattan tend to not be actually from nyc with the exception of neighborhoods like little italy or greenwich village etc but neighborhoods like bensonhurst in brooklyn or bayside in queens or throgg's neck-pelham bay in the bronx have always had more of like a tied down and strong sense of community which is tough to come by in manhattan to give you an example i live in throgg's neck-pelham bay in the bronx which is a bit of a strange neighborhood it has a lot of houses with front lawns back yards porches barbecues in the summertime just that basically kind of generic'all american sort of feel to it everyone here tends to know everyone generally because everyone in throgg's neck has a tendency to spend most of their lives in throgg's neck they grow up in houses that have been owned by their family for like decades etc etc throgg's neck has a lot of the italian delis and pizzerias and restaurants you'd find in most neighborhoods-today it does n't have the same strong'italian-american neighborhood sense it did when i was a kid in the nineties but it certainly did in the sixties i would personally recommend you set your story here as not only did throgg's neck-pelham bay identify with this strong italian-american culture it also has a bit of a unique feeling to it most neighborhoods do n't but you ca n't go wrong with benshonhurst east new york in brooklyn ozone park or howard beach in queens etc etc also even today a good deal of my italian-american friends from this neighborhood seem to gravitate towards the police force so there's a strong nypd sort of culture here i'm not like an authority on the subject but like i said i've lived here most of my life so i have a bit of an insider sort of perspective on life in throgg's neck so if you would like more information feel free to inbox me good luck with your story also : spike lee's'summer of sam was shot pretty

ehhhhhhhhh they give me 3 dishes and they look overwhelming i ordered just a pho noodle and they give one dish for carb & broth another one for protein and the other one for even greens all for 9 dollars i came into a huge windfall today i feel that this is nutritionally complete and look at these ribs these grill marks they are perfectly roasted on the grill hang on a moment let me count the pork because i want to distribute them evenly so that the pork is not running out before i finish the noodle one two three four\u2026 there are 7 pieces of pork ribs total this dish alone can even be served as a meal now let me start eating soup first um they serve hot hot hot soup some restaurants fail to serve the soup hot enough and i hate that the broth should always be hot so that i can burn the roof or my mouth lukewarm soup that is the worst oh i almost forgot that i should bury my greens and bean sprout in the ground of this bowl below the noodle coil before this soup loses its heat i like the bean sprout half boiled to the extent it still has its crunchiness in the core also i should not forget to squeeze the lime wedge and then bury it in the soup too let me start to eat the noodle first without the pork slurping woooow what is that this honest broth with softly cooked rice noodles umai my sour throat does not have any difficulty swallowing it then let \u2019 s have noodles with a piece of rib these thick plastic chopsticks are a little slippery but it is ok i can handle because i am an asian slurping - my mouth full of noodle+soup+rib hooooo this pork rib is for real the savory smell of the fire instantly permeates the soup and the noodles i am savoring the harmony of the flavors they are pleasantly mixed in my mouth and making a perfect harmony a large mouthful of food - it is such a great satisfying feeling beyond compare i do not think of anything now it is a meditation let me just have the rib alone chewing wooooow this rib moist chewy inside and crispy outside and this real fire smell i especially love this chewy part of the thin membrane from the bone and what is the seasoning they used i taste some soy sauce and sweetness it is similar to the korean kalbi seasoning or i don \u2019 t know\u2026 but it is clear that the ribs were well marinated and the protein is keeping the seasoning this sweet soy sauce seasoning was partly burned when grilled adding intense fire smell eating and slurping ah my stomach is full i can not eat anymore i ate all anyway waiving my hand for check \u201c are you a student you can get student discount with

greenwich village for 13 years or longer this is my son joshua david crouch josh lost his life on september 18 2006. and as of today we still have no closure this was a hit and run on the corner of westside highway and west 12 street supposedly no one saw this happen really this is in the heart of the meat packing district and also supposedly at 3:30 monday morning i stood on that corner for 24 hours a few weeks after this happened and it is a very busy area does anyone in the city recall this can someone come forward with information as we here know our pain never goes away and josh being gone has left such a hole in our hearts josh has a brother eric who is now 32 and kristen who is now 28. eric \u2019 s first child and our first grandchild grandson will arrive next week and as an honor to eric \u2019 s brother he is naming him easton joshua crouch this accident can still be looked up online i could go on and on about my visits to the city concerning people i spoke with and walked with for many years trying to find out something mysteriously people i spoke to all of a sudden stopped corresponding with me police first responders ada eliot felig newspaper editor and even mayor bloomberg \u2019 s assistant at the time this didn \u2019 t happen in a secluded park or rest stop and if anyone has ever been to this corner at the river and park one knows that this is a busy area of nyc at all times of the day in closing people talk and someone knows something if by any chance there is information of who did this on my word you will remain anonymous please help ... .. \u201d for some reason this post hit me and i commented this was joshua \u2019 s father \u2019 s reply to me after i suggested maybe this was something more than a hit-and-run \u201d > \u201d that's crazy gresh88 that is exactly what we think my wife never felt like this was the spot josh was supposedly three times the drunk limit and they bogus nypd say he walked from the bar `` employees only'' at 510 huston street to westside hwy and west 12th street and then was hit crossing to go to the park at the river he was maybe 140 pounds soaking wet and never ever would have made it that far that's it that's how they left it they basically pushed me aside very mysterious deeds by new york's finest. \u201d i did a little more digging online and found another post from what looks like his father 1 year after the \u201c accident \u201d occurred on another website this is what he wrote regarding what happened to joshua : > \u201d on september 18,2006 my son joshua aka leftist of brooklyn new york was killed in the early morning hours on the street in the west village of new york to this day almost a year later there are no witnesses clues or new information by the nypd this police force was/is neglegent in their investigation of my son's death west 12 street and west street or known by some as the westside highway is a very well lit area near the hudson river park at all times of the day this area is also well traveled at all hours of the day yet according to the nypd there were no witnesses and josh apparently lay in the middle lane for nearly an hour before being & quot ; found & quot ; by to police officers when found josh was already cold which takes at least an hour to occur josh is a founding member of the hip-hop crew mindspray from the bushwick section of brooklyn and was/is well admired by those who know him is this a cover up by the nypd because one of their own was driving drunk and mowed josh down was josh beaten and thrown from a fast moving vehicle the m.e said that joshua's facial injuries were some of the worst he has seen a police sergeant told me then later recanted his story that & quot ; i have been a police officer for a long time and the injuries to your son's face were not from a vehicle but most likely from some type of instrument maybe a bat & quot ; two weeks later this sergeant said he never said anything like that i have been asked & quot ; why was josh on streets at 3:30 a.m. in new york there are alway's people on the streets. \u201d to me there definitely seems to be more to this story than what has been offered to this poor family i think this one hit me because of how likely it could happen to anyone and how a parent never stops loving their children and even more than 10 years later this father is still looking

accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new

vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you \u2019 d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you \u2019 d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you \u2019 d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to

manhattan the obvious choice until my job circumstances changed i think for some people manhattan makes sense as an initial landing spot especially if you are still figuring out where you may be

for apartments based on whatever subway lines is closest to your school e.g anything that is nearby the subway stops along the the a b c d and 1 subway lines you can check on the mta's map here for what the closest stops are that way you wo n't have to worry about transferring from one train to another which is common for many on commuting to work myself included & nbsp ; ahead of all that you will definitely need to learn how to navigate the subway at some point in time there's no easy 1-2-3 guide for this and a youtube is probably faster but going by looking at the mta subway map plus the key shown there on the top-right corner plus when in doubt always ask a friendly face e.g an officer security any mta workers you come across booth agents anyone who is n't in a rush better to ask then to get lost below are my top few points when going anywhere by train at least & nbsp ; * technically every stop black and white dots is a **local stop** where all **local trains** stop at * white dots though mean that that stop is also an **express stop** these are the only stops **express trains** go to within that borough * and for both points above : these are not always true though on the weekends and/or due to never-ending construction so always check google maps the mta app and any other train-apps you use for help on how to navigate from one stop to another & nbsp ; for example take the 1/2/3 train lines these are the lines marked as red in the map notice how the 1 train is listed on every stop on the red line you can consider that the *local train* and look again to the white dots along the red lines see how they're marked as 2 or 3 this means the 2 and 3 are the *express trains* at least in manhattan once you go to another borough though like brooklyn at that point the trains can differ from being `` express'' in manhattan to `` local'' in brooklyn so again take a good look at the maps for where you need to go identify the trains you need and more importantly if lost ask someone & nbsp ; as for neighborhoods to look in i'd check anywhere within inwood washington heights upper west side uws and west of harlem anything nearby columbia university as starting points for your search if you're looking to stay along the 1 train", "if you google \u201c mta trip planner \u201d you can type in your starting and final destination addresses and it will tell you

the wrong way up the bike lane whip around corners without looking shoot through gaps and clip you on their way by -stay well away from any commercial vehicles - panel vans box trucks but especially private carting services they will kill you and keep going -turning vehicles are supposed to yield to you when crossing the bike lane but they usually don't -use streets with bikes lanes and take it easy going faster does n't mean you get there faster there is a sweet spot for cruising speed -expect anyone/everyone to step out in front of you be ready to stop not ready to swerve because there may be another cyclist coming up on your other side -please be mindful about how you blow intersections go behind crossing peds not in front -past the 20th of every month the cops are looking to fill their ticket quotas keep an eye out before you take the red light they post up in the uws ues les/east village along the major commuter avenues 1st & 2nd -get one bike to ride for pleasure and one beater to commute on/run errands/lock up use 2 ulocks kryptonite offers insurance/guarantee if you register and always lock up next to a nicer bike and or one that is n't locked as well as yours -you need a bell on your handlebars at all times and lights after sunset/before sunrise to be legal -check out the hudson river greenway it goes along the entire west coast of manhattan and is car-free and

wanted to get to *on my block* nevermind in my neighborhood the standard in nyc is so high that if you go somewhere even kind of nice it's extremely likely that it will be great stay relaxed that said

pizza joes is great i like bleecker st. pizza more * if you want an awesome greaseburger in a dive setting i love paul's da burger joint their burgers are $ 12- $ 17 iirc * zabb elee is delicious isan thai which is different from most of the thai that americans are used to * i do not recommend any sushi that you can find for < $ 15pp it exists but it's not better than cheap sushi i've been able to get anywhere else in america waste of an nyc meal probably honestly i would n't really recommend spending less than $ 40pp on sushi anywhere in nyc it's definitely a special occasion food here * if you do n't have a reservation yet at peter luger you will have to wait in line i recommend getting there early and being prepared to wait a couple hours at the bar and calling ahead to make sure it's going to be okay i've only ever eaten there with a reservation there are other great steakhouses that are n't in as high of demand and imo the difference between any two places with $ 40+ steaks is a matter of preference they're mostly all great the ones that are n't great have universally bad reviews * i recommend mexican from food trucks many of them are on yelp if you're going to eat from a food truck i prefer mexican to any of the other cuisines there's a pretty nice but very expensive for the size of the portions taco place on 15th or 16th less than a block west of union sq i do n't remember the name there's also a fast-casual like chipotle place called tres carnes on 23rd and 6th or 7th that does bbq meats in mexican preparations it's delicious * there are two levain locations there is one in the uws and one in harlem the harlem location has *dramatically* shorter lines think 5 minutes instead of 45-70 but since their turnover is n't as high the cookies are n't usually warm if you're going to eat them when you get them then the uws location is better if you're going to take them to your hotel or something then you might as well go to the harlem location the harlem

i was just so excited to make nyc my home my roommate sent me pictures of our future apartment and it was rental love at first sight i told him to sign on the spot the author on moving day after i

\u2019 m sincerely sad was not taped for my later entertainment he also walked around the neighborhood at night to give my father \u2014 his brother \u2014 a full report after he assured my dad the neighborhood wasn \u2019 t completely terrible but also pointing out the staircase in my building looked just like the one in a crack-den apartment in serpico he made me get mace which i still carry

haven \u2019 t here \u2019 s why : in new york everyone is crazy in some way \u2014 from larry david to michael bloomberg so if you go into any new york neighborhood under the assumption that everyone is crazy you will always have your guard up and your eyes forward do i get whistled at in the street \u201c ay mama \u201d sure but it \u2019 s no different than assholes in their first suits from

york in early january from out of state and the whole rental process has been a doozy to figure out i do have a couple questions for you : & # x200b ; 1. regarding the pet deposit - i feel like i've seen a few listings that have mentioned charging a monthly fee for pets instead of a one time deposit is that legal if so is it common 2. when you say that landlords should only take 1 month deposit - does that mean that when renting a new apartment you will be paying security deposit & first month rent only - and not last month as well most places i've been reading about have said to be prepared to pay first last and security deposit 3. in your experience what do you think my chances are of viewing and finding an apartment in the days between christmas and new years i'll be in town for a short window of time and am banking on being able to see a bunch of places in one day but also do n't want to get my hopes up i'm planning on living in harlem and have been considering working with a realtor since i'm physically far away and also on somewhat of a time crunch i'm happy to dm you if you think you'd be able to work with me", "advice are you moving this winter read this i know how difficult moving in the winter can be going out there when it's freezing cold to see apartments is no fun i work in real estate so i've used my experience plus the most recent advice posts on r/nycapartments to create this small q & a for people moving this winter : **first question most people ask -** where do i live which is the safest neighborhood where are the cheapest apartments - let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you \u2019 d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you \u2019 d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you \u2019 d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have"], "hell's kitchen": ["grocery delivery options my prime delivery instant cart and mercato do n't have delivery times to

advice on best safe neighborhoods in any of those areas since we are newbs > our initial requirements are : - at least 700 square feet - laundry on site but realllllly want in-unit laundry - quick commute to dt manhattan in manhattan is the preference - 4k or less a month - want an open kitchen so you need to manage your expectations here ... chelsea and tribeca are incredibly expensive areas and you wo n't find these things in those areas upper west side is somewhat doable but you need to be thinking in a more flexible frame of mind you can find most of what you want but this city is very much a city that you get what you pay for so tacking on requirements is going to make your search tougher you can find a pretty good sized kitchen but again it's going to be a good sized kitchen for nyc not huge overall big enough for two people is doable in unit laundry is something that costs significantly extra here so i would not insist on this you may be able to find something you like with it but it's rare at $ 4000 and below 700sqft is definitely doable i saw someone else suggest a doorman and that again is something that will cost money and you will give something up for in return no matter what neighborhood you end up is going to be incredibly safe so you really do n't need to be concerned about safety i am a real estate agent who was born and raised here and have lived almost my

kitchen - trailer - set in hell's kitchen in 1978", "thanks for sharing just to clarify this picture is from 1931. the first parade was held by macy's in 1924 and it was known as the macy's christmas parade the route was six miles long beginning on 145th street and convent avenue and continuing down to herald square it included bands floats that matched the displays in the windows of macy's and a procession of live animals from the central park zoo here is a picture of some of the elephants marching in the first parade at the end of the group was santa who was crowned `` king of the kiddies'' in front of macy's and unveiled the festive window displays over 250,000 people gathered to watch the procession and it was such a wild success that macy's immediately announced that it would be an annual tradition the first balloon felix the cat made its debut in 1927. new york once had an interesting thanksgiving tradition which sprang from the old evacuation day celebrations evacuation day celebrated on november 25th commemorated the day that the last of the british left the city in 1783 every evacuation day people would parade around with flags and banners holding patriotic dinners by the mid-1800s these groups known as `` fantasticals'' were well known for dressing up in zany costumes and going about the city eating heartily drinking heavily and acting mischievously children eventually developed their own version dubbed `` ragamuffin'' parades as many of the children dressed up as tramps and vagrants costumes of all kinds were seen they would go around to houses ask `` anything for thanksgiving'' and receive pennies candy or fruit the fantastical/ragamuffin parades were still being held across the city through wwi but in the 1920s and 30s they largely fell out of fashion only seen in certain neighborhoods like the lower east side and hell's kitchen some sections of brooklyn held them until the 1950s new york governor al smith had fond memories of participating in these celebrations as a boy", "several explanations exist for the original name hells kitchen an early use of the phrase appears in a comment davy crockett made about another notorious irish slum in manhattan five points according to the irish cultural society of the garden city area : when in 1835 davy crockett said `` in my part of the country when you meet an irishman you find a first-rate gentleman ; but these are worse than savages ; they are too mean to swab hell's kitchen'' he was referring to the five points according to an article by kirkley greenwell published online by the hell's kitchen neighborhood association : no one can pin down the exact origin of the label but some refer to a tenement on 54th street as the first `` hell's kitchen'' another explanation points to an infamous building at 39th as the true original a gang and a local dive took the name as well ... a similar slum also existed in london and was known as hell's kitchen local historian mary clark explained the name thus : ... first appeared in print on september 22 1881 when a new york times reporter went to the west 30s with a police guide to get details of a multiple murder there he referred to a particularly infamous tenement at 39th street and tenth avenue as `` hell's kitchen'' and said that the entire section was `` probably the lowest and filthiest in the city'' according to this version 39th street between 9th and 10th avenues became known as hell's kitchen and the name was later expanded to the surrounding streets another version ascribes the name's origins to a german restaurant in the area known as heil's kitchen after its proprietors but the most common version traces it to the story of `` dutch fred the cop'' a veteran policeman who with his rookie partner was watching a small riot on west 39th street near tenth avenue the rookie is supposed to have said `` this place is hell itself'' to which fred replied `` hell's a mild climate this is hell's kitchen'' hell's kitchen has stuck as the most-used name of the neighborhood even though real estate developers have offered alternatives of `` clinton'' and `` midtown west'' or even `` the mid-west'' the clinton name used by the municipality of new york city originated in 1959 in an attempt to link the area to dewitt clinton park at 52nd and eleventh avenue named after the 19th century new york

surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you \u2019 d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you \u2019 d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you \u2019 d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to

lines you can check on the mta's map here for what the closest stops are that way you wo n't have to worry about transferring from one train to another which is common for many on commuting to work myself included & nbsp ; ahead of all that you will definitely need to learn how to navigate the subway at some point in time there's no easy 1-2-3 guide for this and a youtube is probably faster but going by looking at the mta subway map plus the key shown there on the top-right corner plus when in doubt always ask a friendly face e.g an officer security any mta workers you come across booth agents anyone who is n't in a rush better to ask then to get lost below are my top few points when going anywhere by train at least & nbsp ; * technically every stop black and white dots is a **local stop** where all **local trains** stop at * white dots though mean that that stop is also an **express stop** these are the only stops **express trains** go to within that borough * and for both points above : these are not always true though on the weekends and/or due to never-ending construction so always check google maps the mta app and any other train-apps you use for help on how to navigate from one stop to another & nbsp ; for example take the 1/2/3 train lines these are the lines marked as red in the map notice how the 1 train is listed on every stop on the red line you can consider that the *local train* and look again to the white dots along the red lines see how they're marked as 2 or 3 this means the 2 and 3 are the *express trains* at least in manhattan once you go to another borough though like brooklyn at that point the trains can differ from being `` express'' in manhattan to `` local'' in brooklyn so again take a good look at the maps for where you need to go identify the trains you need and more importantly if lost ask someone & nbsp ; as for neighborhoods to look in i'd check anywhere within inwood washington heights upper west side uws and west of harlem anything nearby columbia university as starting points for your search if you're looking to stay along the 1 train", "yeah at least one of you should be there in person holding copies of everyone \u2019 s documents since places get snapped up within hours of going on the market just so you know the guarantor is often required to make 80-100x the rent of the entire apartment not just what your friend would pay for their room i think you should look in new jersey or perhaps upper manhattan neighborhoods like inwood on that budget a sort of average 2 bedroom would be $ 3,000 not in

ideal routing for a subway route is to have the express go to the end of the line and the local to stop short maybe about 5-8 stations in from the end of the line this is because in most cases in the

implementations of this is a/c in inwood/washington heights there the c can terminate at 168th without any interference at all with a train on the 6 they try to implement a similar pattern but there are some hiccups due to the track layout near parkchester for those on the outer stations they put up with the delays there since then their train will run express all the way to 125th the alternative running expresses to parkchester and running the local all the way to pelham bay would be better for train efficiency but is less convenient for passengers as most will all get off at parkchester wait

in-unit laundry - quick commute to dt manhattan in manhattan is the preference - 4k or less a month - want an open kitchen so you need to manage your expectations here ... chelsea and tribeca are incredibly expensive areas and you wo n't find these things in those areas upper west side is somewhat doable but you need to be thinking in a more flexible frame of mind you can find most of what you want but this city is very much a city that you get what you pay for so tacking on requirements is going to make your search tougher you can find a pretty good sized kitchen but again it's going to be a good sized kitchen for nyc not huge overall big enough for two people is doable in unit laundry is something that costs significantly extra here so i would not insist on this you may be able to find something you like with it but it's rare at $ 4000 and below 700sqft is definitely doable i saw someone else suggest a doorman and that again is something that will cost money and you will give

their loyalty to the apartment and secret brotherhood therein the reason for this is because they will be sleeping on the kitchen floor while the bedroom is used for ritual / hazing activities if interested the pledge could begin the program prior to the lease formally beginning as well we have drafted a rigorous program that draws several comparisons to that of sigma nu theta chapter for several weeks or even months the pledge will be tasked with maintaining pristine upkeep of the apartment during the day and then hazed by the tenants into the night when they get home from work there

can be going out there when it's freezing cold to see apartments is no fun i work in real estate so i've used my experience plus the most recent advice posts on r/nycapartments to create this small q & a for people moving this winter : **first question most people ask -** where do i live which is the safest neighborhood where are the cheapest apartments - let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you \u2019 d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you \u2019 d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you \u2019 d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have"], "little italy": ["that famous pizza place in little italy with the coal oven that is supposed to be one of maybe 2 or 3 places commonly referred to as the best pizza in

going away just because you do n't like it", "little italy new york city - 1974", "arrivederci little italy", "hello i am a new yorker and i've lived here most of my life i'm also a fiction writer and i do some historical fiction tbh like many have said there's a ton of different neighborhoods you can choose from each with their own distinctive flavor so finding one should be easy i'd recommend making your character from the outer boroughs like the bronx or queens or brooklyn as even back in the sixties manhattan was already on its way to becoming the sort of glamorized cultural landmark it is today-meaning lots of folks from manhattan tend to not be actually from nyc with the exception of neighborhoods like little italy or greenwich village etc but neighborhoods like bensonhurst in brooklyn or bayside in queens or throgg's neck-pelham bay in the bronx have always had more of like a tied down and strong sense of community which is tough to come by in manhattan to give you an example i live in throgg's neck-pelham bay in the bronx which is a bit of a strange neighborhood it has a lot of houses with front lawns back yards porches barbecues in the summertime just that basically kind of generic'all american sort of feel to it everyone here tends to know everyone generally because everyone in throgg's neck has a tendency to spend most of their lives in throgg's neck they grow up in houses that have been owned by their family for like decades etc etc throgg's neck has a lot of the italian delis and pizzerias and restaurants you'd find in most neighborhoods-today it does n't have the same strong'italian-american neighborhood sense it did when i was a kid in the nineties but it certainly did in the sixties i would personally recommend you set your story here as not only did throgg's neck-pelham bay identify with this strong italian-american culture it also has a bit of a unique feeling to it most neighborhoods do n't but you ca n't go wrong with benshonhurst east new york in brooklyn ozone park or howard beach in queens etc etc also even today a good deal of my italian-american friends from this neighborhood seem to gravitate towards the police force so

evacuation day celebrated on november 25th commemorated the day that the last of the british left the city in 1783 every evacuation day people would parade around with flags and banners holding patriotic dinners by the mid-1800s these groups known as `` fantasticals'' were well known for dressing up in zany costumes and going about the city eating heartily drinking heavily and acting mischievously children eventually developed their own version dubbed `` ragamuffin'' parades as many of the children dressed up as tramps and vagrants costumes of all kinds were seen they would go around to houses ask `` anything for thanksgiving'' and receive pennies candy or fruit the fantastical/ragamuffin parades were still being held across the city through wwi but in the 1920s and 30s

shop that \u2019 s known for whipping up classic pies apple/blueberry/etc as well as unique signature pies such as this spring cordial chocolate chess to name a few in a tightly packed 6 seater windowsill area also does a decent job with cheesecakes cookies in-house ice cream and savory pies such as chicken pot & amp ; the rare shepard \u2019 s pie one of my favs in the city for a quick slice **what is it** : seasonal berries & amp ; lemon curd baked with mascarpone cream & amp ; baked on a buttery crust then glazed with a bold berry topping this is one of their seasonal pies in time for summer and depending on the time of year can also be whipped up either raspberry or raspberry this one being strawberry paired with a ample sized scoop of their in-house made vanilla bean ice cream **price** : near 10 $ pie was 6,75 $ ice cream was 3 $ nyc tax was nearly a buck well at least it \u2019 s good pie\u2026 **opinion** : it \u2019 s been a considerable while since i \u2019 ve

\u201c maybe this wouldn \u2019 t be a bad idea \u201d and ordered this and as with nearly all of my pies ; a la mode while all of that was going on i was setting up my spot on where to shoot when i \u2019 ve grabbed my china w/ pie it was gleaming red smelled a small bit like strawberry & amp ; lemon with ice cream beginning to melt due to the humid air outside & amp ; the warmth created from the pie ovens inside snapped my photos almost 40 and then ate this in a flash loved the tart tang this pie gave the strawberries were well prepared not frozen fortunately the crust was flaky & amp ; palpable and the ice cream helped with the presentation as well as creamy flavor just wish i could \u2019 ve ordered water i was then pensive about getting another slice of pie but i \u2019 ve ran out

county** the first half of my life i now live elsewhere in new york state i spent a large amount of my free time in manhattan when i was younger the two of us are likely going to be back in nyc for a couple days next month so i had the inkling to ask her while we were there the question is how and where i want to avoid cliche and touristy spots although i never lived there myself i was in the **lower east side** as much as possible when i was a young indie-rock/raver bridge-and-tunnel kid i gravitated towards the bohemian culture of nyc as much as possible i made **astor place/st marks/tompkins square/alphabet cit**y my constant hangouts so if that gives any sense of the flavor i might want to stick to ... or what ideas/spots i would abhor or want to avoid my first two ideas i had are both a bust well the second one might be able to be modified first one was that i had a connection to get us into a taping of the **daily show** her and i both share the same sense of humor and we love comedy/satire/etc my connection was going to try to set something up where i might be able to propose on-set prior to the taping with j.s being involved in some schticky way but jon stewart ended up going on sabbatical so i ended up thinking it did n't have the same sensibility with the fill-in host there second idea centered around my girlfriend's predisposition towards things vintage/ancestral/genealogical and also the fact that my family has this rich history in the nyc immigrant story i wanted to plan a whole day of immigrant-related historical stuff : **statue of liberty ellis island tenement museum in** what is left of **little italy** then i wanted to conclude it by going to the spot where my great-grandmother lived after she came over from italy i'm finding i was n't the only one in my family with a connection to the les i always assumed my great-grandmother lived in little italy but just discovered she really lived in what's now **alphabet city** also my uncle lived just off **tompkins square** when he was a beatnik painter in the early 60's part of these immigrant and les-related themes i'm trying to brainstorm within stems from the fact that i am giving my girlfriend an **antique ring** owned by my great-grandmother that i recently had restored here's the problem with my great-grandmother's former residence and proposing there : they have since turned the entire block she lived on into a giant **coned power substation** that is not publicly accessible not that i would want to propose there if it was obviously my girlfriend is *not* from the **nyc-metro area** and has no real connections to it other than her ancestors likely passed through ellis island even if they did n't live in nyc she definitely has no shared experiences regarding the les so if i did anything related to that i'd have to find a way to fold her into the story somehow ... or present it in some context of me revealing my past and'turning my whole person

of /r/weddingplanning suggested i post here : getting ready to pop the question to my girlfriend i lived in the **bronx** and **westchester county** the first half of my life i now live elsewhere in new york state i spent a large amount of my free time in manhattan when i was younger the two of us are likely going to be back in nyc for a couple days next month so i had the inkling to ask her while we were there the question is how and where i want to avoid cliche and touristy spots although i never lived there myself i was in the **lower east side** as much as possible when i was a young indie-rock/raver bridge-and-tunnel kid i gravitated towards the bohemian culture of nyc as much as possible i made **astor place/st marks/tompkins square/alphabet city** my constant hangouts so if that gives any sense of the flavor i might want to stick to ... or what ideas/spots i would abhor or want to avoid my first two ideas i had are both a bust well the second one might be able to be modified first one was that i had a connection to get us into a taping of the **daily show** her and i both share the same sense of humor and we love comedy/satire/etc my connection was going to try to set something up where i might be able to propose on-set prior to the taping with j.s being involved in some schticky way but jon stewart ended up going on sabbatical so i ended up thinking it did n't have the same sensibility with the fill-in host there second idea centered around my girlfriend's predisposition towards things vintage/ancestral/genealogical and also the fact that my family has this rich history in the nyc immigrant story i wanted to plan a whole day of immigrant-related historical stuff : **statue of liberty ellis island tenement museum in** what is left of **little italy** then i wanted to conclude it by going to the spot where my great-grandmother lived after she came over from italy i'm finding i was n't the only one in my family with a connection to the les i always assumed my great-grandmother lived in little italy but just discovered she really lived in what's now **alphabet city** also my uncle lived just off **tompkins square** when he was a beatnik painter in the early 60's part of these immigrant and les-related themes i'm trying to brainstorm within stems from the fact that i am giving my girlfriend an **antique ring** owned by my great-grandmother that i recently had restored here's the problem with my great-grandmother's former residence and proposing there : they have since turned the entire block she lived on into a giant **coned power substation** that is not publicly accessible not that i would want to propose there if it was obviously my girlfriend is *not* from the **nyc-metro area** and has no real connections to it other than her ancestors likely passed through ellis island even if they did n't live in nyc she definitely has no shared experiences regarding the les so if i did anything related to that i'd have to find a way to fold her into the story somehow ... or present it in some context of me revealing my past and'turning my whole person over to her as cheesy as that sounds she also loves art and museums the last

can find most of what you want but this city is very much a city that you get what you pay for so tacking on requirements is going to make your search tougher you can find a pretty good sized kitchen but again it's going to be a good sized kitchen for nyc not huge overall big enough for two people is doable in unit laundry is something that costs significantly extra here so i would not insist on this you may be able to find something you like with it but it's rare at $ 4000 and below 700sqft is definitely doable i saw someone else suggest a doorman and that again is something that will cost

was around 17 or so i was working at a retail store in manhattan there was a manager who worked there who was maybe 22-24 years old at that time word was going around that he was having a party somewhere in midtown and most of the staff got invited so i went with a coworker and we met up at my place before hand and went together the place that it was being held was a slim building that was packed between two newer buildings around 32nd street and maybe 6th ave i ca n't remember anymore when you got in downstairs the staircase was no wider than 3.5 feet making it pretty much single file

ice and beer people could just pick up it was pitch black too with no windows a low ceiling and music coming from somewhere that i could n't tell on the second floor there was the same sized room

people were trying to convince each other to try and see if they could figure out how to work it everyone was just kind of circled around it staring ... .. on the landing outside of the `` red room'' was a tiny bathroom with no lock or sink just a toilet on the third floor there was just an exit to what i assume is the roof but people just were sitting on the steps up there and smoking weed and i'm sure other stuff but i was too naive to realize at the time there were also so many people there like i do n't even know why they were there there was n't much music except for that one room and the music was n't very loud and there were people congregating all over so it was hard to move around and we had to pay $ 15 at the door after about an hour and a half i left it was really strange

original name hells kitchen an early use of the phrase appears in a comment davy crockett made about another notorious irish slum in manhattan five points according to the irish cultural society of the garden city area : when in 1835 davy crockett said `` in my part of the country when you meet an irishman you find a first-rate gentleman ; but these are worse than savages ; they are too mean to swab hell's kitchen'' he was referring to the five points according to an article by kirkley greenwell published online by the hell's kitchen neighborhood association : no one can pin down the exact origin of the label but some refer to a tenement on 54th street as the first `` hell's kitchen'' another explanation points to an infamous building at 39th as the true original a gang and a local dive took the name as well ... a similar slum also existed in london and was known as hell's kitchen local historian mary clark explained the name thus : ... first appeared in print on september 22 1881 when a new york times reporter went to the west 30s with a police guide to get details of a multiple murder there he referred to a particularly infamous tenement at 39th street and tenth avenue as `` hell's kitchen'' and said that the entire section was `` probably the lowest and filthiest in the city'' according to this version 39th street between 9th and 10th avenues became known as hell's kitchen and the name was later expanded to the surrounding streets another version ascribes the name's origins to a german restaurant in the area known as heil's kitchen after its proprietors but the most common version traces it to the story of `` dutch fred the cop'' a veteran policeman who with his rookie partner was watching a small riot on west 39th street near tenth avenue the rookie is supposed to have said `` this place is hell itself'' to which fred replied `` hell's a mild climate this is hell's kitchen'' hell's kitchen has stuck as the most-used name of the neighborhood even though real estate developers have offered alternatives of `` clinton'' and `` midtown west'' or even `` the mid-west'' the clinton name used by the municipality of new york city originated in 1959 in

of time of year a listing that has been up online for long probably means there's something wrong and anyone who viewed it found something that convinced them not to sign top floor walk up noisy neighbors did not look like photos as advertised it could also mean nothing at all best to check out for yourself not always the case sometimes listings are just over priced and there are better deals out there even the crappiest of apartments will rent quickly if it's a good value relative to other options > according to a couple brokers i spoke to - not all landlords require 40x rule and it will depend on their preference and neighborhood i think the higher end the neighborhood the more likely they will require this yes and no it has to do with who is managing the apartment if the apartment is managed by a management company almost always 40x i know landlords who only require 35x and some who require as much as 50 or 60 for couples ones who do n't care tend to be in less popular areas of

suggestions for raving : * coat check is almost always worth the $ 3- $ 5 be outraged by the price but it's about 1/2 to 1/3 the cost of a drink and gives you peace of mind that someone's not going to steal your shit i bring a small kanken bookbag and stuff my coat sweater costume accessories etc in then check just 1 bag it can harsh your trip if you're constantly worrying where your things are having to keep an eye on your shit instead of enjoying the moment very important take a picture of your coat check tab with your phone in case you lose it * cool venues have free water available ; many will serve you tap water especially when you order a drink if you need to buy bottled water expect to pay $ 5-6 outrageous sure just hold onto the bottle and refill in the bathroom * take a shower beforehand and wear deodorant do n't be smelly and nasty * stay hydrated because a few reasons at a really great party or a poorly ventilated one things can get hot and sweaty if you're dancing you're definitely working up a sweat and if you are on e you will sweat profusely especially at higher doses you may not feel thirsty but you might be losing a lot of water and combined with drugs and alcohol can make you feel very not well if i'm really raging i figure i drink about one 16oz bottled water every hour * test yo shit it does n't matter if you're getting it from your bestie if you havent seen test results then you dont know wtf you got the dark net is reliable high quality i've never received legit mdma when bought in person but i have gotten some pretty funky other nasty things i wouldnt put in my body always test be safe a quick easy high is n't worth the risk especially with the fentanyl thing going on * ask before *touching* anybody `` consent'' is a big thing most community members feel safe at parties because the community culture respects consent for example asking before giving a hug some people just are n't in the mood kindly respect that * maturity is key handle yo shit know your limit and stay below it do n't poop other peoples party by getting sick or being rude or shoving through the crowd - if you're getting sloppy then it's time to go home if you become a regular in the `` scene'' and people see that you're still keeping it classy at the end of the party they're very apt to invite you to an afterparty - which in most cases ends up being even more awesome than the party itself was * there are a couple after-hours clubs in bushwick that i know of - they advertise more than they used to but i'll leave you to find them for yourself they typically open around 4am and go until noon or 2pm the crowd tends to be fueled by stimulants and eagerly and openly consuming more and be a bit older and more mature and have a bit higher of an income since they can afford the second admission price + `` fuel'' some `` afters'' have really cool vibes and some feel like crack dens looking at you bushwick a/v you got ta find the right ones to go to and usually the newer ones are better admission is usually about $ 40 most serve booze the entire time but the crap ones bushwick a/v do n't serve until like 10am drinks are mad expensive basically go to afters if you feel like you have at least another 2 hours of party left in you some are kinda down-tempo and ketamine-y and some are banging house and techno and coke-y my favorite is that raging 5am melodic tech-house taking me to new heights while the sun rises < 3 * dance however makes you feel happy nobody cares how ridiculous you might look - it's all about free expression move your body to the beat however feels right to you try out different moves move your feet ugh people you have to move your feet to dance shuffling looks cool - check out some youtube videos * always have your drink in your hand or in front of you and even better if you cover it with a small napkin and be careful what drink you take - swim once inadvertently dosed himself by drinking from the wrong water bottle * i love going out alone i go where i want when i want a big plus is not having to babysit anyone i do n't have to hang around an event i do n't want to be at because other people want to stay or have to leave because other people want to go and if i get invited someplace afterward it's usually a lot better if i'm one or two people than 3+ * most of the people who really participate in the `` scene'' are super friendly and love to meet cool new people and welcome them into the fold it may seem like everyone knows everyone or it's one degree of separation but for the most part it is very welcoming and not exclusive and `` judgy'' * do n't let one or two bad experiences ruin your curiosity for raving there are a lot of parties in nyc and most of them are `` meh'' at best some are really super friggin awesome check resident advisor * someone mentioned kostume kult's valentines lunar new year party being on feb. 14th i'm producing the event and while it's going to be uh-may-zing it is meant to be a bit more low-key than the 3 big parties we throw each year - it's in a swanky new big midtown bar and the sound system although good quality will be tiny in comparison to a proper rave since it has to be in a space with low ceilings our parties are based around costuming and theatrics - we do a lot of cool quirky and interactive things and have some really cool artists and art pieces on display check out our black & light ball horned ball or `` freakk show'' parties in the next few months * for many of us nightlife is an opportunity to do and be the things that our jobs and society tell us are unfashionable or taboo during normal waking hours and it is an outlet for creative expression some of us like to dress up in interesting or elaborate outfits or costumes in funky prints and styles or craft our own costume pieces just for fun some of us like to bend the norms of what clothing each gender is `` supposed'' to wear because they ca n't do it at work or around most of their friends but it is still a significant part of their self-identity ... and it feels really great to confidently express oneself * meeting new people is easy but do n't be creepy i was very introverted when first entering nightlife and over the years have learned some handy tricks to break the ice with strangers simply ask if they know which dj is playing if they do ask what time they play until and who comes on next ask if they've been to the venue before - then ask if they have these sortsa parties there often this opens up so many opportunities for conversation if you smoke invite them out for a smoke most people are friendly and cool * a really really great party can be a magical experience an overwhelming feeling of happiness and completeness full of good vibes and good energy and wow i've only been to a couple such parties over the years but they are so memorable and i want that experience again * parties usually start around 10pm-11pm people do n't really start arriving until 60-90 minutes after doors open people who are just drinking or sober usually go home around 3am-4am when the bar closes after 5am 5:30 6am that is when the party really gets going super high energy really great vibes really great music and oftentimes really unique venues i've felt like i've landed in a hollywood movie a couple times - i never imagined seeing that side of new york city : -o * tip for stashing pills and'cid : tape to the underside of your weewee so it rests on your sack take it out soonish after getting through security so it does n't get wet with sweat * be discrete with your chemicals do n't be fking obvious and especially at legal venues most will throw you right out if you're busted being in the middle of a crowded

vendors and food/drinks now the first place appeals to my very very small rational side its in midtown manhattan 1500 for everything for 6 hours the place has an outside set that could make a great make-shift stage a dj booth and large vacant bar booth for us to provide our own liqour through their bar unfortunately no inside stage and the space is probably big enough to fit 50 - 60 max thus id do appetizers the 2nd location is in queens with a full stage dining tables for catering and vending projector screen for visuals i wanted to announce my crowdfunding trailer here so thats a must and can handle a crowd of up to 150 max for about $ 2000 more than i wanted to pay but not out the realm of possibility the event is simply a summer party : i want to come out n eat enjoy indie hiphop/rnb/alternative music possibly get a lil drunk and have small business vendors sell their products but im concerned if a location with less frills in a highly accessible area and better price is superior than a place that can easily capture the ambience i wanted in a more obscure location such as flushing queens my first event was in brooklyn i made the misake of booking a place that could easily handle a crowd of 300+ but had a crowd of 60 so it looked pathetic althought the turnout was good for my first event not too mention it was a ridiculous amount of unexpected rain that day the manhattan space holding 60 makes it seem more logical based on previous crowds but having no stage inside and a nice makeshift outside i fear it could rain again and completely kill that option i know

the 25 people to hang out on the corner waiting so that i alone can bike through like a prima donna just because i have the right of way i'm fine with pedestrians the real problem is the allocation of

width parking lanes alone are wider than the sidewalks we bicyclists and pedestrians are natural allies in retaking this space we need sensible legislation reform : rolling idaho stops for bicyclists advanced pedestrian green to also be legally treated as advance bicycle green and do away with jaywalking pedestrians crossing the street against the light or midblock is not a crime if they do so

can not stress enough is that you really should not stress too much about finding the absolute best food in your price range in your neighborhood new york has too much food there is so much food that in several of my previous apartments i never made it to every restaurant that i wanted to get to *on my block* nevermind in my neighborhood the standard in nyc is so high that if you go somewhere even kind of nice it's extremely likely that it will be great stay relaxed that said depending on how long you're going to be here you might have a hard time sticking to less than $ 15 per person for dinners -- in my experience < $ 20 is pretty much the standard for as-good-as-it gets family dining food all the things you mentioned are delicious * ramen there are tons of top-10 lists you ca n't really go wrong but totto is near midtown is in the $ 14- $ 19 range * nyc has great pizza joes is great i like bleecker st. pizza more * if you want an awesome greaseburger in a dive setting i love paul's da burger joint their burgers are $ 12- $ 17 iirc * zabb elee is delicious isan thai which is different from most of the thai that americans are used to * i do not recommend any sushi that you can find for < $ 15pp it exists but it's not better than cheap sushi i've been able to get anywhere else in america waste of an nyc meal probably honestly i would n't really recommend spending less than $ 40pp on sushi anywhere in nyc it's definitely a special occasion food here * if you do n't have a reservation yet at peter luger you will have to wait in line i recommend getting there early and being prepared to wait a couple hours at the bar and calling ahead to make sure it's going to be okay i've only ever eaten there with a reservation there are other great steakhouses that are n't in as high of demand and imo the difference between any two places with $ 40+ steaks is a matter of preference they're mostly all great the ones that are n't great have universally bad reviews * i recommend mexican from food trucks many of them are on yelp if you're going to eat from a food truck i prefer mexican to any of the other cuisines there's a pretty nice but very expensive for the size of the portions taco place on 15th or 16th less than a block west of union sq i do n't remember the name there's also a fast-casual like chipotle place called tres carnes on 23rd and 6th or 7th that does bbq meats in mexican preparations it's delicious * there are two levain locations there is one in the uws and one in harlem the harlem location has *dramatically* shorter lines think 5 minutes instead of 45-70 but since their turnover is n't as high the cookies are n't usually warm if you're going to eat them when you get them then the uws location is better if you're going to take them to your hotel or something then you might as well go to the harlem location the harlem location is also across the st from double dutch coffee which pulls possibly my favorite espresso in the city it's

good beer and top hops are good for downtown bread & honey and clinton gourmet in midtown west beer run in midtown east and milk & hops city swiggers and city hops on the ues but you'll pay a substantial markup at the secondary retail stores rather than buying directly from a brewery if your guests are keyed into the hype brewery scene you should also keep an eye out for great notion cans

beer to-go bread & honey and clinton gourmet in west midtown/hells kitchen are both great downtown there's top hops carmine street beer good beer and probably something i'm forgetting milk & hops on

half is always worth a visit especially if you're looking to pick up cans to bring back you can also check out threes which is n't so far and always has some neipa on tap and their guest tap lines can

day your mileage may vary the neighborhood of lic also has a ton of breweries and stuff to do and can be easier to get to from midtown/uptown manhattan than bk i'd recommend starting at lic beer project walking to john brown smokehouse for some bbq they have a great tap list heading over to fifth hammer brewing then finishing up at alewife you can also stop at big alice and rockaway but i'm not crazy about either especially for ipa and big alice is a bit out of the way if greenpoint's new brewery is open when you're here you can also walk there from alewife or fifth hammer in about 10-20 minutes there's also finback who to me make the best ipa in the city after oh and grimm but their brewery is a real pain to get to singlecut has a great spot and makes good stuff but is also a bit

something up and hope they get it right we were hoping that you lovely folks of r/nycbars had a few recommendations of places that already have some mocktails printed on the menu that means they've already thought the drink through should be prepared to make it quickly and without much thought and hopefully there will be a few options at least the ideal place as mentioned above would have a

women would have reservations about meeting guys online hell i \u2019 ve never done it before and it it \u2019 s weird as hell tbh i was in a pretty serious relationship for almost 10 years since i was 18 we were engaged for almost 3. without delving too much into it ... she cheated on me i left her all the rest is just bs drama i never understood why my mind is so peculiar and by peculiar that my subtle yet flagrant attempt at expressing humility ; which is an exercise in futility as i \u2019 m about to extinguish any shred of modesty by vehemently stating something that might piss you off i \u2019 m most likely smarter than you this is not some self-proclaimed title i \u2019 ve audaciously given myself like some pompous asshole while somewhat egocentric allow me to explain here is where i redeem myself i think i \u2019 m stupid as hell as a matter fact i know i \u2019 m stupid as hell i once ordered a three-piece lamp from amazon that was so easy & effortless to assemble it didn \u2019 t even include an instructional manual more like a cooking recipe on the back of a 2 \u201d by 6 \u201d lamented card that which ironically i found to be that silver lining for it provided solace and smelled of \u201c new car scent ; \u201d the kind of scent that makes you nostalgic yet optimistically reminiscing the past in hindsight to create a fantasy of a hypothetical future scenario i digress after 88 minutes of frustration i broke the lamp forcing the pieces together in an almost primitive manner for i could not let the lamp best me : then my brother whose 5 years younger so 23 walks in which just adds more stress and frustration as he repeats \u201c let me do it \u201d like a goddamn parrot \ud83e\udd9c incessantly a bit of crazy glue on the broken piece and i was right back at square one with the three assembled pieces or rather unassembled pieces when i finally conceded and handed it to my younger brother who proceeded to emasculate me in the most humiliating manner by literally assembling it within 15 seconds and not even looking at the bullshit postcard \u201c instructions. \u201d my point i think outside the box i don \u2019 t think i \u2019 m smart i just think i \u2019 m different and i know everybody wants to be different but believe me all i want is to be normal i \u2019 m pretty phenomenal at sociology behavioral science & cognitive ability also critical thinking and the defect would be my mind fires and 12 directions at once even now as i \u2019 m writing this i \u2019 m multitasking two other things while thinking of 8. took the official stanford-binet iq test proctored for lulz i scored 146 supposedly the 98th percentile at which point i will now proceed to revert back to the narcissistic pathetic over-compensating loser by stating that i was pissed i found it absolutely irresponsible & irredeemable on my part that 2 % of human beings on this planet scored higher than me that \u2019 s roughly 160 million people i refuse to accept that there are 160 million apes on this planet who have better cognitive behavior analysis memory & photogenic memory to the capacity as the tldr self-loathing douche yours truly whose writing this so enough rambling here is my proposal i work a lot i don \u2019 t have many friends probably because i set the bar pretty high because i am untenable i \u2019 m stubborn to a fault and egregiously fatalistic however if you \u2019 re a hidden gem \ud83d\udc8e someone who is able to reciprocate and complement my characteristics and personality traits both defects faults and strengths in a way that it simply is easy ... we just click together like the aforementioned lamp that my codependent incompetency revealed i \u2019 m incapable of doing i can however build a door processor gpu in under 20 minutes with all components nuts bolts and tools included so don \u2019 t ask me how that is possible i can only surmise that the lamp was simply too easy to assemble that i couldn \u2019 t do it again another narcissistic thing to say but let me get to my proposal i tried dating apps and they \u2019 re awkward as hell definitely not for me after six months of hating myself for being inadequate so much so i worshipped the ground walked on by a woman i \u2019 ve devoted my best years to & purchased an $ 18,000 beyonc\u00e9 like engagement ring \ud83d\udc8d that would in short define who i am : a hopeless romantic whose into grand gestures & somewhat old fashioned ... i suppose so initially i was going to go with some random girl i met on insert dating app by politically correct liberal where you objectify women by \u201c swiping \u201d left or right ; immediately dismissing an entire human being in what is ironically the most sexist behavior engaged by our generation : in that it \u2019 s essentially cyber solicitation of sex ... in 2019 apps developed by leftists whom vehemently oppose any form of sexual harassment whatsoever stanford university study reveals calling a woman \u201c sweetheart \u201d or gently consoling her with a hug pat on the shoulder or other non-intrusive forms of contact intended for the sole purpose of lifting her mood assuming she \u2019 s upset yet these are the same women and men who in large part are the embodiment of neo-liberalism and the ones supposedly on the forefront of the # metoo movement yet you are literally flicking your finger left & right like kublai khan in a harem don \u2019 t get it twisted i \u2019 m only a fiscal conservative but socially liberal now to my point assuming you \u2019 re out there and still reading gem\ud83d\udc8e i have using a variety of psychology/behavioral science research concluded the most effective means to ask a woman out on a first date is to essentially not objectify her ... more irony for you so i propose a 1-way blind date what does that mean it \u2019 s self-explanatory i will show you a picture of me and you don \u2019 t have to show me anything tomorrow i have the day planned from moma in the morning/afternoon to the central park zoo to a wine tasting event at a prestigious italian bistro 1982 chateau bordeaux \ud83c\udf77 = the best wine on earth then we hit the most fresh baked bakery in midtown for yum \ud83d\ude0b cake or cannolis afterwards we can \u2022 go to the planetarium \u2022 see a broadway \ud83c\udfad show \u2022 play glowing mini golf \u2022 dave n busters \u2022 painting event \u2022 comedy club \u2022 real club/bar \u2022 ripleys theater \u2022 spa facial & massage so in all we can meet up around noon the date ends as soon as you say it does at any given time throughout the day if you want to go i will call you a lyft and kindly remind you chivalry is not dead by kissing your hand wishing you a wonderful evening and thanking you for giving me the privilege of getting to know you & make sure the driver is competent enough to get you home i am not asking for anything more than a first date i \u2019 m not superficial everybody says that but i \u2019 m proving it ask anything i \u2019 ll send you pictures and videos and all i ask in return is 2 things : 1 your name obv lol 2 your honesty you don \u2019 t have to tell me who you are or say anything that you \u2019 re not comfortable sharing : all i want to do is spend one day with you haha as you can probably summate i can have a tendency to talk a lot i \u2019 m not asking you to do anything but be yourself if this sounds like something you \u2019 re interested in and you are a woman in nyc available tomorrow afternoon-evening & might be interesting dm me \ud83d\ude43 & we can talk for a simple halfhour i doubt i \u2019 ll need longer to determine if i want to spend my only/first day off from work in 5 months again i don \u2019 t need anything but your honesty and a first name no surname requests or id unless you look like you \u2019 re under 18 lol j/k but in the spirit of full disclosure i am 28 going on 18. i don \u2019 t think i ever grew up i don \u2019 t just look young but i behave young & sometimes rather impulsively however i can promise you this you will never be loved by anybody as much as you will by me and that \u2019 s something i can declare with absolute certainty ... assuming you \u2019 re out there gem \ud83d\udc8e for it takes a special woman to tolerate a loser like me and in all honesty i definitely don \u2019 t deserve you but i am asking heart in hand anyway i don \u2019 t expect to hook up i don \u2019 t care if it \u2019 s only platonic i just want to hear about your day & have some fun

can get to the center of that range the better i would consider living on 11th too far from the subway for me but they do have some very nice new residential buildings there and many offer a shuttle

prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you \u2019 d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you \u2019 d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you \u2019 d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have"], "morningside heights": ["westside market in morningside heights does

circumstances changed i think for some people manhattan makes sense as an initial landing spot especially if you are still figuring out where you may be spending your time in terms of work and social

true brooklyn's gotten more expensive so harlem is now comparable in price and the uws is lovely central park and morningside park are gems i did find that in some ways my neighborhood in manhattan

**searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you \u2019 d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you \u2019 d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you \u2019 d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have"], "murray hill": ["u/atabbyd > originally looking for manhattan upper west chelsea midtown tribeca but would be open to brooklyn/queens would love advice on best safe neighborhoods in any of those areas since we are newbs > our initial requirements are : - at least 700 square feet - laundry on site but realllllly want in-unit laundry - quick commute to dt manhattan in manhattan is the preference - 4k or less a month - want an open kitchen so you need to manage your expectations here ... chelsea and tribeca are incredibly expensive areas and you wo n't find these things in those areas upper west side is somewhat doable but you need to be thinking in a more flexible frame of mind you can find most of what you want but this city is very much a city that you get what you pay for so tacking on requirements is going to make your search tougher you can find a pretty good sized kitchen but again it's going to be a good sized kitchen for nyc not huge overall big enough for two people is doable in unit laundry is something that costs significantly extra here so i would not insist on this you may be able to find something you like with it but it's rare at $ 4000 and below 700sqft is definitely doable i saw someone else suggest a doorman and that again is something that will cost money and you will give something up for in return no matter what neighborhood you end up is going to be incredibly safe so you really do n't need to be concerned about safety i am a real estate agent who was born and raised here and have lived almost my entire life here i would suggest the following neighborhoods to find the best results and are the closest to what you're looking for in a neighborhood : the upper west side the upper east side hell's kitchen kips bay/murray hill and the east village in brooklyn williamsburg park slope cobble hill boerum hill carroll gardens and gowanus those are all great

about : **1. safety** **2. schools** **3. convenience for grocery and family events** and for affordable i am thinking maybe **2 bed room under 800k** since that was about what the most we can afford we prefer buying rather than renting because that might be more cost effective in the long term but if renting are much more worthy in certain neighborhood we are open to it thanks for reading this

single word allegedly rationalizing my residence but what if i actually just like it i assure them harlem is safe place to live mentioning a duane reade just opened three blocks from my apartment and they breathe a semi-sigh of relief \u2014 how did i get to harlem after i got accepted to grad school in nyc i made plans to live with one of my best friends from high school and college who was going to grad school at columbia i immediately booked a one-way ticket from tampa \u2014 my hometown \u2014 and told my roommate i trusted him completely to choose our new apartment i had no clue where i would be moving ; i was just so excited to make nyc my home my roommate sent me pictures of our future apartment and it was rental love at first sight i told him to sign on the spot the author on moving day after i told my uncle where my apartment was he has lived in nyc for over 30 years ; thus he acts just how you \u2019 d think he ripped me about 50 new assholes \u201c harlem are you crazy \u201d he asked \u201c do you know where that is do you know how dangerous it could be \u201d he wouldn \u2019 t stop making comparisons to my neighborhood and serpico and midnight cowboy and still hasn \u2019 t to this day the very next day he went to my neighborhood met my roommate for the first time and stood on my stoop for hours he walked around the neighborhood he talked to people on my block which i \u2019 m sincerely sad was not taped for my later entertainment he also walked around the neighborhood at night to give my father \u2014 his brother \u2014 a full report after he assured my dad the neighborhood wasn \u2019 t completely terrible but also pointing out the staircase in my building looked just like the one in a crack-den apartment in serpico he made me get mace which i still carry and named himself deputy commissioner of /u/i_keep_it_real_ \u2019 s security tepidly he gave three-fourths of his blessing i flew into jfk weeks later cabbed it to hamilton heights and promptly twirled about our beautiful big apartment carrie-style i went to explore the neighborhood which wasn \u2019 t scary to me at all it \u2019 s a mostly-dominican neighborhood complete with a mcdonalds that delivers only three blocks from my apartment sure i don \u2019 t live in carrie bradshaw \u2019 s new york but recently i realized that jay-z \u2019 s lyrics from \u201c empire state of mind \u201d are about my hood \u2014 yes that \u2019 s my mcdonald \u2019 s : i used to cop in harlem/all of my dominicanos right there up on broadway/brought me back to that mcdonald \u2019 s so no my neighborhood is not tribeca but it \u2019 s beautiful and cool in its own right i found my favorite places to eat and walk within time i \u2019 ve seen every ethnicity in my neighborhood : students families and everyone else \u2013 if i feel safe in harlem what is the lingering stigma about harlem that makes people scared for me first frankly it \u2019 s because i \u2019 m not a big black thug second there \u2019 s the crime history third i think harlem makes people think of a lone tumbleweed rolling down a deserted street landing at the door of a shady pawn shop do i feel safe i never haven \u2019 t here \u2019 s why : in new york everyone is crazy in some way \u2014 from larry david to michael bloomberg so if you go into any new york neighborhood under the assumption that everyone is crazy you will always have your guard up and your eyes forward do i get whistled at in the street \u201c ay mama \u201d sure but it \u2019 s no different than assholes in their first suits from

another hip racially mixed couple to not mess with we \u2019 re not he \u2019 s gay i like to pretend we \u2019 re lady gaga and usher taking a stroll just living our lives like my roommate and i

every morning cheerfully sweeping his stoop in a wifebeater and tube socks as opposed to many other manhattan neighborhoods there are no women on macrobiotic diets dictating to nannies on the sidewalks on the contrary women in my neighborhood let their husbands have it in the middle of the street often wearing tropical-colored get-ups everyone is loony in their own charming way \u2013 there \u2019 s more to my neighborhood than its diversity from a girlish perspective my apartment features crown molding exposed brick and a washer/dryer in my bathroom from a real estate perspective the pre-war architecture of my neighborhood is incredible i don \u2019 t live in a shoebox and the rent is reasonable and from a thug perspective my address lends me a bit of street cred the cashier

can charge at work and there \u2019 s a shower here as well because i plan on sweating and pedaling for part of the ride i wonder if the cost to maintain such an e-bike would make this cost

be allowed to bring such a thing up the elevator at work a full on motorcycle would be another idea but the tolls make it more expensive and i would n't be able to go through red lights yes i know

3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you \u2019 d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you \u2019 d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you \u2019 d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have"], "nolita": ["exactly 73 percent of my monthly income goes towards my

stir fried with your choice of protein if you want soup go for hand pulled if you want stir fried go for hand peeled i love their roast pork but the combo is also great if you get soup make sure to try some w/ black vinegar * violet's bake shop for bhan mi * t-swirl crepe - japanese style crepes get one for dessert the half size is plenty * mi tea - bubble tea with very good tea selection get tea + cheese foam if you do n't want tea/caffeine their fruit selections are also really good * spy c - good not great szechuan dry pot is pretty standard the farm house pork is something i really like get out at roosevelt ave where you'd be switching to a bus most likely : * lhasa fast food - famous small tibetan place i have n't actually been yet * playground - one of my favorite thai places only open for dinner they do n't fuck around with heat and there's a lot of funky fermented fish taste in just about everything i love the broken rice croquettes i love crispy rice and sour/savory combinations * momo crave - tiny place not traditional at all but they make some really great dumplings i suggest the vegetable filling i think it's the most interesting and the sukuti momos the sandeko momos tandori momos and the chili momos * khao kang - if you're up for a little bit more of a walk this is a great thai spot $ 10 gets you a big plate of rice and 2 options for the prepared

going out there when it's freezing cold to see apartments is no fun i work in real estate so i've used my experience plus the most recent advice posts on r/nycapartments to create this small q & a for people moving this winter : **first question most people ask -** where do i live which is the safest neighborhood where are the cheapest apartments - let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you \u2019 d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you \u2019 d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you \u2019 d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have"], "stuyvesant town": ["moving to nyc for job starting in july hi all i'm originally from texas and have rented in indiana before but neither of these are remotely close to

were probably wise to choose a different name for the new deli they opened in east williamsburg late last year even though the new place pastrami masters adopted its core menu from david \u2019 s > > when new yorkers hear the word brisket these days they tend to think of brick pits stacks of cordwood neon shiner beers signs and willie and waylon singing in the background those associations are relatively recent ones locally dating to the renaissance of the smoked-meat sciences in texas and the national fame of pit masters like aaron franklin in austin > > before brisket was synonymous with barbecue its meaning in the five boroughs was the one that you now encounter mainly around the jewish holidays : a flat slab of beef breast cooked in a closed humid environment for hours at which point it not only falls apart unprovoked but also makes its own gravy > > that dish has long been one of the chief attractions at david \u2019 s brisket house although david \u2019 s has had many owners and probably other names as well it is thought that the deli was founded by two jewish men around the middle of the last century before most of the remaining jews in bedford-stuyvesant left for the suburbs back when a brooklyn deli could announce itself as a brisket residence and everybody would know just what that meant > > at david \u2019 s braised brisket is sliced and stacked into hero rolls hard rolls and rye some of the locals who meander in from nostrand avenue \u2014 although david \u2019 s has occasionally had bouts of fame and sometimes draws visitors from manhattan most of its trade comes from longtime inhabitants of bedford-stuyvesant \u2014 prefer their brisket in another of its forms : pickled as corned beef or better yet brined and smoked under a jacket of pepper and other spices as pastrami still others like to combine multiple brisket treatments in a single sandwich > > fuad hassan and the other owners of david \u2019 s imported this formula more or less intact for pastrami masters making one striking change before opening the storefront they had leased on grand street was being vacated by a counter-service lebanese restaurant called wafa \u2019 s express there may not have been enough fans of hummus and baba ghanouj to keep wafa \u2019 s in business but there were some fans nonetheless and mr. hassan decided to try to hold on to them by fusing the lebanese menu almost in its entirety to the jewish deli offerings pastrami masters is not kosher but it is halal ; mr. hassan like the other owners is a muslim who was born in yemen > > the mastery of pastrami masters does not extend to the actual brining of corned beef or the smoking of pastrami like most other deli owners in new york mr. hassan buys both meats from a supplier although he does cook them on site and he says he gives the pastrami an extra rubdown of seasoning > > one effect of the name pastrami masters is that pastrami is now the uncontested star it is diana ross while the corned beef and brisket are the supremes falafel and hummus are in the backing band > editors \u2019 picks > the neighborhood name game > no cell signal no wi-fi no problem growing up inside america \u2019 s \u2018 quiet zone \u2019 > sorry but working from home is overrated > > this is roughly how i see the menu too the corned beef tends to be steamed slightly too long until it is a little pallid and spongy mustard revives it part of the way what restores it almost completely is being made into a reuben > > the brisket is soft and juicy even without extra gravy but it always seems to be missing something that something could be pastrami stacked one on top of the other the two meats round each other out ; the pastrami makes the brisket more interesting and loses some of its salty intensity in the process > > but the highest use of the brisket at pastrami masters is an easily overlooked entry on the menu called the brooklyn cheese steak : hot brisket gravy and melted american cheese on a hero roll with fried peppers and onions this is one of those treasures of bodega cuisine the food created by unsung meat slicers and egg scramblers using standard ingredients found in and around the deli case > > the most celebrated example of bodega cuisine in new york is the chopped cheese which shares some characteristics with the brooklyn cheese steak unlike a chopped cheese the brooklyn cheese steak doesn \u2019 t have lettuce and tomatoes on it the crunch of lettuce wouldn \u2019 t be welcome on top of the brisket but the savory support of saut\u00e9ed peppers and onions most > > definitely is as is the polite sharpness of american cheese > > when pastrami masters finally trots out its breakfast menu some time in the next month or so it will begin offering another classic of bodega cuisine : the pastrami egg and cheese sandwich if it is made the same way as the one that david \u2019 s brisket house has served for longer than anyone remembers it will be a compelling way to start the day > > like the other sandwiches it will be improved if you request thick slices of pastrami deli-style rotary slicers are used and when i haven \u2019 t specified a thickness my pastrami has sometimes been sliced too thin thicker slices seem to give the sandwich greater resistance which is important with meat that has been steamed into submission as thoroughly as it has at pastrami masters > > i wish the pastrami and corned beef were sliced with knives as they are at katz \u2019 s delicatessen on the other hand pastrami masters makes sandwiches in four sizes not just a single one the size of a hiking boot neither deli uses rye worth singing about as for the pastrami if it were not for the different slicing techniques i \u2019 d call it a tie > > the lebanese food was more convincing before the change of ownership the falafel lately has been densely packed and gummy ; makdous baby eggplants stuffed with spiced chopped walnuts have been bland and rubbery ; the dips and salads have wanted salt and another squeeze of lemon lamb shawarma is still wonderful though so thickly seasoned with cloves pepper cinnamon and other spices that it is almost furry and while the kenafeh i had gave the impression of having been stashed in the dessert case too long the baklava is still sweetly evocative doused with just enough rose water to give you the sensation of lying on a bed near an open window next to a rosebush on a warm night in june > > these are nice embellishments but when you go to pastrami masters your main objective will be one form of brisket or another served in some old-fashioned new york way this is not to be clear a modern artisanal product of the kind that people now associate with brooklyn with meat from weird-looking heritage breeds and levantine spices that flew to the united states in their own business-class seat for that kind of pastrami sandwich now that harry & ida \u2019 s is gone your best bet is lunch at the new hometown bbq in industry city where the meat is smoked on site and sliced as thick as dominoes > > it is very good but it has a little more texas in it than the archetypal skyscraper sandwich

preference - 4k or less a month - want an open kitchen so you need to manage your expectations here ... chelsea and tribeca are incredibly expensive areas and you wo n't find these things in those areas upper west side is somewhat doable but you need to be thinking in a more flexible frame of mind you can find most of what you want but this city is very much a city that you get what you pay for so tacking on requirements is going to make your search tougher you can find a pretty good sized kitchen but again it's going to be a good sized kitchen for nyc not huge overall big enough for two people is doable in unit laundry is something that costs significantly extra here so i would not insist on this you may be able to find something you like with it but it's rare at $ 4000 and below 700sqft is definitely doable i saw someone else suggest a doorman and that again is something that will cost money and you will give something up for in return no matter what neighborhood you end up is going to be incredibly safe so you really do n't need to be concerned about safety i am a real estate agent who was born and raised here and have lived almost my entire life here i would suggest

neighborhood to move into i have read a couple earlier threads on the subject on reddit which were very helpful \u2013 i figured i would just lay out my own situation / priorities to see if that might change the recommendation anyhow i'm 32 and single i \u2019 m a decent ways into my career and work from home at this point budget isn \u2019 t really a concern within reason \u2013 i can afford up to 8k a month in rent by the standard nyc 40x rent rule i am mainly looking for the ideal neighborhood on the basis of quality of life issues : primarily night life dating restaurants access to events/activity general cleanliness subway access i guess i'd also prefer the general crowd to be more mid 20s-30s instead of fresh out of college i have seen a lot of recommendations of west village / greenwich village i am strongly considering that area but the apartments are of course often quite old / rough even at a relatively high price point in the village and i \u2019 d tend to prefer more of a modern highrise with a view i was also thinking about chelsea / meatpacking which seems to have some nicer highrise doorman type buildings tribeca looks nice but apparently is pretty dead for a youngish single guy from what i've heard are there other areas you would recommend a lot of nice buildings seem to be in the midtown area but i do n't know if the general craziness and traffic of that area would be worth it from what i can tell uws/ues are probably too slow paced and family oriented to be ideal at this point the lower east side in general seems to be a little less appealing than the west side from most of what i've seen and read - i could certainly be wrong anyhow any advice would be appreciated thanks", "tribeca/fidi is looking more or leas the same but with masks and people

specifically my commute which is down the hudson greenway or brooklyn which has got more rich genxers and millennials riding bikes the `` not a cyclist just a guy on a bike'' types and therefore gets more visibility and more respect from the press which is a shame because queens my favorite borough aside from that take the approach to the qbb on the lic side for example you've got this weird section where the bike path goes on the sidewalk across a blind crossing with fast moving car traffic then more sidewalk then you're on the bridge itself which is fine aside from the pm 2.5. then you get off the bridge and it's the fucking east side which is a total nightmare and then there's within queens people do n't look before they door you not that they ever look but i've had more close calls in queens than anywhere else then there are the supposed protected bike paths which are just like the supposed protected bike paths in manhattan except the cagers travel at 45mph instead of the actual speed limit then there's the fact that they randomly close the qbb for arbitrary reasons at arbitrary hours and there's no real backup triboro illegal to ride yeah yeah'but i do it i'm not going to advocate planning a commute that involves an illegal segment you can go down to the wbb or the mb but that's kind of a journey unless the other end of your commute is in tribeca in which case

ticket from tampa \u2014 my hometown \u2014 and told my roommate i trusted him completely to choose our new apartment i had no clue where i would be moving ; i was just so excited to make nyc my home my roommate sent me pictures of our future apartment and it was rental love at first sight i told him to sign on the spot the author on moving day after i told my uncle where my apartment was he has lived in nyc for over 30 years ; thus he acts just how you \u2019 d think he ripped me about 50 new assholes \u201c harlem are you crazy \u201d he asked \u201c do you know where that is do you know

beautiful and cool in its own right i found my favorite places to eat and walk within time i \u2019 ve seen every ethnicity in my neighborhood : students families and everyone else \u2013 if i feel safe in harlem what is the lingering stigma about harlem that makes people scared for me first frankly it \u2019 s because i \u2019 m not a big black thug second there \u2019 s the crime history third i think harlem makes people think of a lone tumbleweed rolling down a deserted street landing at the door of a shady pawn shop do i feel safe i never haven \u2019 t here \u2019 s why : in new york everyone is crazy in some way \u2014 from larry david to michael bloomberg so if you go into any new york neighborhood under the assumption that everyone is crazy you will always have your guard up

in terms of distance to the subway in manhattan but maybe i'm being unrealistic is this distance also going to limit me in terms of food delivery options and stuff is there a lot to do around the immediate area is the area a bit further south of bpc where that liberty plaza is like a huge mall with lots of food/shops thanks for any advice", "just go to tribeca battery park city is suburbs", "which part of chinatown i lived on the border of chinatown and tribeca via an nyu dorm but i've spent a lot of time in chinatown as a chinese american the biggest annoyance is just the number of people there it's always packed and you'll always be fighting tourists and elderly chinese people to get where you need to be in the summers the garbage and fish smell is also much more intense there than any other neighborhood i've lived in on the other hand depending on where in chinatown you live it is very accessible canal street is one hell of a subway station there's tons of cheap food and groceries nearby and it's easy to find all the chinese groceries you need that are n't in regular stores or even other asian e.g korean japanese groceries elizabeth street mall is also a fun place to find cheap gifts and there's lot of other cool little stores", "tribeca is cheaper than the ev whereabouts is the place i mean you can google the surrounding bars and restaurants if you're going to nyu then you'll probably be hanging out in the ev more than tribeca", "tribeca is rich quiet and boring east village is lively and loud depends on what you \u2019 re looking for in a neighborhood for me i prefer living in a low-key neighborhood so i always have somewhere quiet to come home to", "too rich for my blood i do n't spend a whole lot of time near/around the financial district but tribeca never really appealed to me you've got a mix of old money affluent up-and-coming professionals and well-to-do families in a smaller open floor plans it's a trendy neighborhood but it does n't feel charming the way say west village does it's lively and has great restaurants and bars west side highway is a plus for the parks and paths but speaking as an nyu alum east village will fit in way more with your peers especially if you're undergrad loads of students live there there are dorms there and the restaurants are more college speed i lived in 2nd street for a year and really liked the area", "lived there my whole life up until recently tribeca used to be an awesome artist \u2019 s neighborhood with a community and a cool vibe now it \u2019 s compete shit influx of money has forced literally everyone i knew from childhood to move out except one multi-millionaire family everything is incredibly expensive and rent is so high that there are no cheap food options or decent 24 hour delis a pizza pie is $ 30 the best descriptor i have for the current state of tribeca is \u201c soulless. \u201d go live anywhere else i miss my home but not the neighborhood", "maybe i go to the wrong part of tribeca near whole foods but after 7 pm or so the neighborhood is dead and there \u2019 s a ton of homeless hanging around", "east village is infinitely cooler tribeca is a desolate remote place with no warmth and zero cool", "tribeca kind of sucks there are a bunch of restaurants but it has that `` piles of garbage bags on the street'' vibe", "a `` cool'' place depends on who you're hanging with i'm sure if you're an affluent banker or big law associate it's cool in terms of night life/art/'' culture'' ev and surrounding area has a far better reputation than tribeca", "ev is way better than broadway and worth unless you're west of church street i consider that fake tribeca by and large and also totally not worth it at broadway and worth you'll be surrounded by office workers and homeless people", "tribeca is overrated", "the heart of tribeca is the quiet place to go home at night after you go out in the east village broadway & worth is not the heart of tribeca it \u2019 s convenient to trains but the downside is you \u2019 re going to have to take a train or a car to get anywhere interesting you would be walking distance from great bars and restaurants in the east village", "not sure about nightlife but ev has a lot of great cheap food options tribeca does not it's not bad but expect to spend a lot more $ to eat out if your rent really is cheaper in tribeca maybe that will make up for it", "tribeca is pretty tame with families but you can just take a quick train for 15 minutes and in the more lively neighborhoods tribeca is super expensive though i \u2019 m surprised you found a better deal ... are you sure it \u2019 s not chinatown and they \u2019 re just calling it tribeca haha", "is tribeca a cool place to live moving to ny in a month and want to live in close proximity to nyu grad school right now we are deciding b/n a place in ev and a place in tribeca on broadway i would prefer the location to be somewhat lively with good restaurants/bars close by and not dead like fidi so i've heard i know ev is good for that - but the place in tribeca is nicer and a little cheaper bc no fee", "advice are you moving this winter read this i know how difficult moving in the winter can be going out there when it's freezing cold to see apartments is no fun i work in real estate so i've used my experience plus the most recent advice posts on r/nycapartments to create this small q & a for people moving this winter : **first question most people ask -** where do i live which is the safest neighborhood where are the cheapest apartments - let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you \u2019 d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you \u2019 d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you \u2019 d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have"], "two bridges": ["open laundromats in chinatown / les / two bridges hey folks i just walked over to my usual laundromat

chelsea midtown tribeca but would be open to brooklyn/queens would love advice on best safe neighborhoods in any of those areas since we are newbs > our initial requirements are : - at least 700 square feet - laundry on site but realllllly want in-unit laundry - quick commute to dt manhattan in manhattan is the preference - 4k or less a month - want an open kitchen so you need to manage your expectations here ... chelsea and tribeca are incredibly expensive areas and you wo n't find these things in those areas upper west side is somewhat doable but you need to be thinking in a more flexible frame of mind you can find most of what you want but this city is very much a city that you get what you pay for so tacking on requirements is going to make your search tougher you can find a pretty good sized kitchen but again it's going to be a good sized kitchen for nyc not huge overall big enough for two people is doable in unit laundry is something that costs significantly extra here so i would not insist on this you may be able to find something you like with it but it's rare at $ 4000 and below 700sqft is definitely doable i saw someone else suggest a doorman and that again is something that will cost money and you will give something up for in return no matter what neighborhood you end up is going to be incredibly safe so you really do n't need to be concerned about safety i am a real estate agent who was born and raised here and have lived almost my entire life here i would suggest the following neighborhoods to find the best results and are the closest to what you're looking for in a neighborhood : the upper west side the upper east side hell's kitchen kips bay/murray hill and the east village in brooklyn williamsburg park slope cobble hill boerum hill carroll

placement it should be noted that i'm not from nyc but this is my perspective as a resident of the sf bay area which has a much lower overall population density to start lower manhattan looks too dense with 14/18/23/28/34 sts on the 1 having their station exits a 4-5 minute walk away from each other at most i'm assuming the succession made sense with the original shorter irt platform lengths and lower population density at the time of construction but if that were the case why not close 18 st as was done with its lex av counterpart during platform extensions was it rather that the lex av 18 st had to be closed because of the offset platforms at union square crosstown access seems like a pain in the ass with the g being the only rail service ; i presume it's made worse by only having 4-car trains and some awkward station spacing would the section between broadway and 21 st have benefitted from having 2 or 3 more stations as for the second avenue subway : only 3 stations between 63 and 96 sts and no express services in the high-density upper east side ^i'm ^aware ^of ^the ^construction ^cost ^but ^that ^just ^seems ^like ^its ^own ^massive ^problem my overall perception is that stations should be set up such that each one by foot would be somewhere around a 7 to 12 minute walk away from each other depending on locale/population density ; is this a valid viewpoint or an oversimplification and more general questions : * **what works and what does n't about current nyc subway station spacing ** * **if given the opportunity what would you change about station placement assuming overall alignment ca n't be altered ** this can be at any scale from adding/removing individual exits to redoing the system with the same rows", "i went to hunter academically hunter is great

expensive if not more so i'm sure there's a few others worth going to but those are the ones i'm familiar with as for the morningside heights area the closest recommendation i have is dive bar it's on the upper west side so a little far south for a regular destination but just the other day they had the alchemist cans so they're worth keeping an eye on for stuff like that even a little further down is george keeley which has a constantly rotating draft list that you can check into live on their website and even see how much of each keg is left they always have a huge variety of super interesting

beer bars in manhattan if you do n't have a lot of time on the upper east side you have the jeffrey treadwell park the pony bar ues bondurants and city swiggers are all close-ish to each other and have great beers the ginger man and rattle n hum east are also really good bars a couple blocks from each other in midtown then you have the east village/lower east side bars d.b.a. fools gold one mile house and top hops are all basically walking distance from each other if you really want to go to a brewery i suggest heading over to long island city brewing real easy subway ride over there and they're putting out some great beers as others have mentioned there's also a cluster of three breweries lower in long island city that are also easy to get to but the breweries are n't that great outside of transmitter which has a tiny tap room and only sells bombers for you to drink there if you're going to torst keg and lantern brewering is across the street i really like their beers but they do n't get much recognition places near there you may wan na hit are greenpoint beer & ale company and brouweri lane one of the best pizza places in the city paulie gees is right down the block from brouweri lane too brooklyn brewings really close to torst as well the link below is a map of all the beer bars and breweries in the city just find a good clump together and check them out if

worth your time check out jimmy's no 43 in the east village if you want a good selection of local pours burp castle right next door is a solid bar for international beers but they dont let anyone speak over a whisper ... it's kinda weird but if you want good beer it's a great place i'd also recommend mug's alehouse and dirck the norseman both in williamsburg brooklyn dirck is a full on brewpub

know how difficult moving in the winter can be going out there when it's freezing cold to see apartments is no fun i work in real estate so i've used my experience plus the most recent advice posts on r/nycapartments to create this small q & a for people moving this winter : **first question most people ask -** where do i live which is the safest neighborhood where are the cheapest apartments - let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you \u2019 d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you \u2019 d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you \u2019 d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have"], "upper west side": ["need to replace my laptop's usb-c cable asap where can i go considering the shutdown my laptop fell

for manhattan upper west chelsea midtown tribeca but would be open to brooklyn/queens would love advice on best safe neighborhoods in any of those areas since we are newbs > our initial requirements are : - at least 700 square feet - laundry on site but realllllly want in-unit laundry - quick commute to dt manhattan in manhattan is the preference - 4k or less a month - want an open kitchen so you need to manage your expectations here ... chelsea and tribeca are incredibly expensive areas and you wo n't find these things in those areas upper west side is somewhat doable but you need to be thinking in a more flexible frame of mind you can find most of what you want but this city is very much a city that you get what you pay for so tacking on requirements is going to make your search tougher you can find a pretty good sized kitchen but again it's going to be a good sized kitchen for nyc not huge overall big enough for two people is doable in unit laundry is something that costs significantly extra here so i would not insist on this you may be able to find something you like with it but it's rare at $ 4000 and below 700sqft is definitely doable i saw someone else suggest a doorman and that again is something that will cost money and you will give something up for in return no matter what neighborhood you end up is going to be incredibly safe so you really do n't need to be concerned about safety i am a real estate agent who was born and raised here and have lived almost my entire life here i would suggest the following neighborhoods to find the best results and are the closest to what you're looking for in a neighborhood : the upper west side the upper east side hell's kitchen kips bay/murray hill and the east village in brooklyn williamsburg park slope cobble hill boerum hill carroll gardens and gowanus those are all great neighborhoods with a lot going on with ~30 commutes to lower manhattan where you can find most of what you're looking for", "hey there nyc resident i \u2019 m a distance runner and my husband is a road cyclist - he does similar amounts of riding that you do i would look at upper west side for sure or maybe hell \u2019 s kitchen it will give you access to a few train lines that will get you down to the union square area fairly quickly is very close to central park and riverside park has museums and restaurants and most crucially

anything i can or should do in this situation rat him out to the authorities or the co-op board or management company or is he just of a different mindset and i'll just have to deal with that thank

bar history `` the mafia and the gays meticulously documents how the mob controlled many gay bars for decades in new york due to their once illicit status and relies upon an extensive collection of primary sources including fbi files many of which were not previously publicly available the gay bars historically were integrated into the mafia rackets for example the establishments often were financed through mob-tied coin-op vendors and their related loan companies jukebox king alfred miniaci funded dozens of gay bars and other joints controlled by the mafia in the 1950s and 1960s including the peppermint lounge miniaci supplied slot machines in the 1930s to frank costello and had dined with the mob boss on the may 2 1957 night he was shot gay bars sometimes served as drug drops forget about the pizza connection ; this was the pansy connection club 82 in new york \u2019 s east village was a popular club with drag revues and in the 1950s also was part of the distribution network in the genovese family \u2019 s heroin trade for which boss vito was convicted in 1959. gay bars were profit centers for all the mafia families among the powerful mobsters who oversaw vast interests in lgbt nightlife were gambino underboss aniello dellacroce genovese capo matty ianniello and colombo underboss sonny franzese the mafia had ties to some of the most iconic gay establishments including the continental baths in the hotel ansonia from 1969 to 1976 on the upper west side which received protection from the colombo family in exchange for installing its vending machines continental owner steve ostrow \u2013 a classically-trained opera singer \u2013 developed such close ties with joe colombo that he was performing *the star\u2013spangled banner* at the june 29 1970 italian-american unity day rally in columbus circle when the mob boss was shot the lgbt community once was married to the mob out of forced necessity but after gay bars became legal the relationship often continued in many establishments out of mutual convenience gay bars no longer were busted simply for homosexual assembly but they still risked raids if serving as sex clubs or drug drops accordingly the mob still had both services to provide and protection to offer particularly during the party decades following the stonewall riots if a bar had a back room for anonymous sex operated afterhours or sold drugs or boys then odds are it was a mafia joint and that involved numerous places during the 1970s and 1980s indeed the mafia hijacked gay liberation for political cover and used so-called auntie gays \u2013 the uncle toms of the gay community \u2013 as frontmen for their bars to evade suspicion the wiseguys allegedly even infiltrated the christopher street liberation day committee and christopher street festival committee which ran new york city \u2019 s gay pride parade and some related events for much of the 1970s and 1980s over the decades there has been a fair number of gay guys in the mob \u2019 s ranks including cross-dressing genovese soldier david petillo who once was a boy prostitute hitman vito arena from roy demeo \u2019 s gambino crew and

operator or running a subway or the skinny little girl that belted out etta james as a stay at home mom pushing a stroller the band was absolutely fantastic they played regularly with quincy jones the first & only time i went there was a kid from the berkley school for music there it was his birthday & his parents brought him down to nyc so he could come to the sugar bar he had a song that he wrote he had copies of sheet music he gave the band explained a few things & they just started playing while he jumped on the piano while the singers in the band started singing his song i suppose it would work for any open mic night in the city or maybe a bar/restaurant broadway casts go after they're done with their show but the sugar bar was what sparked the idea for me edited to add : this post

subway lines is closest to your school e.g anything that is nearby the subway stops along the the a b c d and 1 subway lines you can check on the mta's map here for what the closest stops are that way you wo n't have to worry about transferring from one train to another which is common for many on commuting to work myself included & nbsp ; ahead of all that you will definitely need to learn how to navigate the subway at some point in time there's no easy 1-2-3 guide for this and a youtube is probably faster but going by looking at the mta subway map plus the key shown there on the top-right corner plus when in doubt always ask a friendly face e.g an officer security any mta workers you come across booth agents anyone who is n't in a rush better to ask then to get lost below are my top few points when going anywhere by train at least & nbsp ; * technically every stop black and white dots is a **local stop** where all **local trains** stop at * white dots though mean that that stop is also an **express stop** these are the only stops **express trains** go to within that borough * and for both points above : these are not always true though on the weekends and/or due to never-ending construction so always check google maps the mta app and any other train-apps you use for help on how to navigate from one stop to another & nbsp ; for example take the 1/2/3 train lines these are the lines marked as red in the map notice how the 1 train is listed on every stop on the red line you can consider that the *local train* and look again to the white dots along the red lines see how they're marked as 2 or 3 this means the 2 and 3 are the *express trains* at least in manhattan once you go to another borough though like brooklyn at that point the trains can differ from being `` express'' in manhattan to `` local'' in brooklyn so again take a good look at the maps for where you need to go identify the trains you need and more importantly if lost ask someone & nbsp ; as for neighborhoods to look in i'd check anywhere within inwood washington heights upper west side uws and west of harlem anything nearby columbia university as starting points for your search if

wednesday forcing transit officials to shut service between brooklyn and manhattan and upending the morning commute for thousands of people the water main break drove water into the subway system around 4:30 a.m. near the bedford avenue station on the l train in brooklyn officials said as a result transit officials suspended service for roughly three hours between the 14th street-union square station in manhattan and the myrtle avenue station in brooklyn the metropolitan transportation authority which operates the subway was running the l train line in two sections \u2014 one in manhattan and one in brooklyn by about 7:30 a.m. the agency reported that l train service had resumed under the east river but with \u201c extensive delays in both directions. \u201d the m.t.a urged commuters to take alternate lines and said that manhattan-bound j and z trains would make local stops in brooklyn during the morning commute new york city has nearly 7,000 miles of water mains and is often plagued by breaks that cause flooding damaging building and critical underground infrastructure including the subway in january a water main break flooded the 103rd street station near central park

prompting a reply from the m.t.a \u201c this unanticipated situation has forced us to make changes to service in order to keep trains moving on as much of the line as possible and our crews have been

admissions a couple months ago our oldest kid is going to be 4 next year my impression is that outside of private schools you are sol as far as g & t with 3rd grade is the last entry point for many such programs on the other hand it's not clear how much g & t will benefit you outside of getting into one of the citywide g & t programs where the curriculum is accelerated the talk mentioned that g & t was largely designed to try to keep uh white middle class parents from moving to the suburbs the main benefit was to get your kid in a room full of kids with a similar socioeconomic background and with parents who are concerned enough about education to have their kids tested for g & t these are nontrivial things the school-based g & ts have `` enriched'' curriculum where the `` enrichment'' is at the discretion of the teacher/school the curriculum is not advanced by a grade which is the case with the city-wide g & t programs anderson nest etc. where they say teach algebra a grade earlier the talk did mention that at least one of the upper west side general elementary schools the talk was given mainly for uws parents actually had better test scores than one of the city-wide g & t

my best friends from high school and college who was going to grad school at columbia i immediately booked a one-way ticket from tampa \u2014 my hometown \u2014 and told my roommate i trusted him completely to choose our new apartment i had no clue where i would be moving ; i was just so excited to make nyc my home my roommate sent me pictures of our future apartment and it was rental love at first sight i told him to sign on the spot the author on moving day after i told my uncle where my apartment was he has lived in nyc for over 30 years ; thus he acts just how you \u2019 d think he ripped me about 50 new assholes \u201c harlem are you crazy \u201d he asked \u201c do you know where that is do you know how dangerous it could be \u201d he wouldn \u2019 t stop making comparisons to

walked around the neighborhood he talked to people on my block which i \u2019 m sincerely sad was not taped for my later entertainment he also walked around the neighborhood at night to give my father \u2014 his brother \u2014 a full report after he assured my dad the neighborhood wasn \u2019 t completely terrible but also pointing out the staircase in my building looked just like the one in a

flew into jfk weeks later cabbed it to hamilton heights and promptly twirled about our beautiful big apartment carrie-style i went to explore the neighborhood which wasn \u2019 t scary to me at all it

i \u2019 ve seen every ethnicity in my neighborhood : students families and everyone else \u2013 if i feel safe in harlem what is the lingering stigma about harlem that makes people scared for me first frankly it \u2019 s because i \u2019 m not a big black thug second there \u2019 s the crime history third i think harlem makes people think of a lone tumbleweed rolling down a deserted street landing at the door of a shady pawn shop do i feel safe i never haven \u2019 t here \u2019 s why : in new york everyone is crazy in some way \u2014 from larry david to michael bloomberg so if you go into any new york neighborhood under the assumption that everyone is crazy you will always have your guard up and your eyes forward do i get whistled at in the street \u201c ay mama \u201d sure but it

be going out there when it's freezing cold to see apartments is no fun i work in real estate so i've used my experience plus the most recent advice posts on r/nycapartments to create this small q & a for people moving this winter : **first question most people ask -** where do i live which is the safest neighborhood where are the cheapest apartments - let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you \u2019 d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you \u2019 d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you \u2019 d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot

certain areas on the e line washington heights etc even if there is n't a shelter someone can go to we have a pretty deep parks department and other organizations that provide housing part of this is because we've always had a homeless problem so we are more equipped to deal with it new yorkers have been dealing with homeless people since it's inception in comparison i think cities like portland and seattle never had quite the same level of homelessness that they have now granted there were some parts that had more homeless than others but the cost of living was so low that you could scrape by when i went to portland for the first time 10 years ago the person i was staying with lived decently on working 20 hours sometimes less per week at an independent coffee shop because of the tech boom in the area from companies like amazon the cost of living has gone way up not to new york levels of course but you still ca n't have a two bedroom that you share with a cool roomie and work 20 hours as a barista anymore and get by if you can get full time work that's great but not everyone is so fortunate and if you can move somewhere cheaper that's cool too but most of the homeless are forced to just pitch a tent and fend for themselves not so much gentrification because alot of the same things are still there the culture has n't changed it's just more expensive to do everything pretty much every time i read the portland mercury online there is an article more or less saying `` what do we do with all these homeless people'' that would n't have even been an issue 10 years ago they do n't know what to do about it because\\- at this magnitude\\- they have n't had to deal with it new york has been asking the question and answering it in several different ways for three

lines is closest to your school e.g anything that is nearby the subway stops along the the a b c d and 1 subway lines you can check on the mta's map here for what the closest stops are that way you wo n't have to worry about transferring from one train to another which is common for many on commuting to work myself included & nbsp ; ahead of all that you will definitely need to learn how to navigate the subway at some point in time there's no easy 1-2-3 guide for this and a youtube is probably faster but going by looking at the mta subway map plus the key shown there on the top-right corner plus when in doubt always ask a friendly face e.g an officer security any mta workers you come across booth agents anyone who is n't in a rush better to ask then to get lost below are my top few points when going anywhere by train at least & nbsp ; * technically every stop black and white dots is a **local stop** where all **local trains** stop at * white dots though mean that that stop is also an **express stop** these are the only stops **express trains** go to within that borough * and for both points above : these are not always true though on the weekends and/or due to never-ending construction so always check google maps the mta app and any other train-apps you use for help on how to navigate from one stop to another & nbsp ; for example take the 1/2/3 train lines these are the lines marked as red in the map notice how the 1 train is listed on every stop on the red line you can consider that the *local train* and look again to the white dots along the red lines see how they're marked as 2 or 3 this means the 2 and 3 are the *express trains* at least in manhattan once you go to another borough though like brooklyn at that point the trains can differ from being `` express'' in manhattan to `` local'' in brooklyn so again take a good look at the maps for where you need to go identify the trains you need and more importantly if lost ask someone & nbsp ; as for neighborhoods to look in i'd check anywhere within inwood washington heights upper west side uws and west of harlem anything nearby columbia university as starting points for your search if you're looking to stay along the 1 train", "washington heights apt looking for someone to sublease 3br/1ba rent 765 1st post hope this works hey i'm looking for someone to take over my lease for

the express go to the end of the line and the local to stop short maybe about 5-8 stations in from the end of the line this is because in most cases in the outer boroughs there are n't enough

inwood/washington heights there the c can terminate at 168th without any interference at all with a train on the 6 they try to implement a similar pattern but there are some hiccups due to the track layout near parkchester for those on the outer stations they put up with the delays there since then their train will run express all the way to 125th the alternative running expresses to parkchester and running the local all the way to pelham bay would be better for train efficiency but is less convenient for passengers as most will all get off at parkchester wait in the heat or cold and then

where are the cheapest apartments - let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you \u2019 d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you \u2019 d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you \u2019 d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have"], "west village": ["i just renewed my lease on feb 1 for two years funny

"you're laboring under two related assumptions that are n't accurate the first is that manhattan is more expensive ; which is n't true the second is that manhattan is more culturally desirable and that living in brooklyn is therefore a cost-conscious compromise as the amount of money people are willing to pay to live in brooklyn suggests that's not true either i'm in turn going to assume that your image of both boroughs excludes the still-gentrifying northernmost parts of manhattan and the distant suburban neighborhoods of brooklyn where our parents used to go visit their grandmothers -- the parts no out-of-towner is talking about when they think of manhattan\u00ae -- bright lights big city -- or brooklyn\u2122 darling of hipsters the world over so knowing only that you're young and that you're affluent but not rich enough for the west village the most likely thing is that you'll be happier in brooklyn the neighborhoods are prettier the cocktails better the restaurants buzzier the grocery stores more gourmet the liquor stores more likely to stock natural wine unless you have a bro's taste for loud shitty bars and would live in like nashville if they actually had an economy

recommendations hi everyone - i'm planning to move to nyc and was hoping to get a little advice on the right neighborhood to move into i have read a couple earlier threads on the subject on reddit

career and work from home at this point budget isn \u2019 t really a concern within reason \u2013 i can afford up to 8k a month in rent by the standard nyc 40x rent rule i am mainly looking for the ideal neighborhood on the basis of quality of life issues : primarily night life dating restaurants access to events/activity general cleanliness subway access i guess i'd also prefer the general crowd to be more mid 20s-30s instead of fresh out of college i have seen a lot of recommendations of west village / greenwich village i am strongly considering that area but the apartments are of course often quite old / rough even at a relatively high price point in the village and i \u2019 d tend to prefer more of a modern highrise with a view i was also thinking about chelsea / meatpacking which seems to have some nicer highrise doorman type buildings tribeca looks nice but apparently is pretty dead for a youngish single guy from what i've heard are there other areas you would recommend a lot of nice buildings seem to be in the midtown area but i do n't know if the general craziness and traffic of that area would be worth it from what i can tell uws/ues are probably too slow paced

dad who was looking for answers or at the very least witnesses to his sons supposed \u201c hit-and-run \u201d accident that occurred september 18,2006. his post pleaded : > \u201d to anyone who has lived in greenwich village for 13 years or longer this is my son joshua david crouch josh lost his life on september 18 2006. and as of today we still have no closure this was a hit and run on the corner of westside highway and west 12 street supposedly no one saw this happen really this is in the heart of the meat packing district and also supposedly at 3:30 monday morning i stood on that corner for 24 hours a few weeks after this happened and it is a very busy area does anyone in the city recall this can someone come forward with information as we here know our pain never goes away and josh being gone has left such a hole in our hearts josh has a brother eric who is now 32 and kristen who is now 28. eric \u2019 s first child and our first grandchild grandson will arrive next week and as an honor to eric \u2019 s brother he is naming him easton joshua crouch this accident can still be looked up online i could go on and on about my visits to the city concerning people i spoke with and walked with for many years trying to find out something mysteriously people i spoke to all of a sudden stopped corresponding with me police first responders ada eliot felig newspaper editor and even mayor bloomberg \u2019 s assistant at the time this didn \u2019 t happen in a secluded park or rest stop and if anyone has ever been to this corner at the river and park one knows that this is a busy area of nyc at all times of the day in closing people talk and someone knows something if by any chance there is information of who did this on my word you will remain anonymous please

\u201d that's crazy gresh88 that is exactly what we think my wife never felt like this was the spot josh was supposedly three times the drunk limit and they bogus nypd say he walked from the bar `` employees only'' at 510 huston street to westside hwy and west 12th street and then was hit crossing to go to the park at the river he was maybe 140 pounds soaking wet and never ever would have made it that far that's it that's how they left it they basically pushed me aside very mysterious deeds by new york's finest. \u201d i did a little more digging online and found another post from what looks like his father 1 year after the \u201c accident \u201d occurred on another website this is what he wrote regarding what happened to joshua : > \u201d on september 18,2006 my son joshua aka leftist of brooklyn new york was killed in the early morning hours on the street in the west village of new york to this day almost a year later there are no witnesses clues or new information by the nypd this police force was/is neglegent in their investigation of my son's death west 12 street and west street or known by some as the westside highway is a very well lit area near the hudson river park at all times of the day this area is also well traveled at all hours of the day yet according to the nypd there were no witnesses and josh apparently lay in the middle lane for nearly an hour before being & quot ; found & quot ; by to police officers when found josh was already cold which takes at least an hour to occur josh is a founding member of the hip-hop crew mindspray from the bushwick section of brooklyn and was/is well admired by those who know him is this a cover up by the nypd because one of their own was driving drunk and mowed josh down was josh beaten and thrown from a fast moving vehicle the m.e said that joshua's facial injuries were some of the worst he has seen a police sergeant told me then later recanted his story that & quot ; i have been a police officer for a long time and the injuries to your son's face were not from a vehicle but most likely from some type of instrument maybe a bat & quot ; two weeks later this sergeant said he never said anything like that i have been asked & quot ; why was josh on streets at 3:30 a.m. in new york there are alway's people on the streets. \u201d to me there definitely seems to be more to this story than what has been offered to this poor family i think this one hit me because of how likely it could happen to anyone and how a parent never stops loving their children and even more than 10 years later this father is still looking for answers do any of you know anything about this are familiar with this area could provide this man answers to his sons death thank you for taking the time out to read this

s kitchen a tier below some of the lower manhattan neighborhoods like west village chelsea east village etc the pros of hell \u2019 s kitchen for me are : - it seems that you can get much more apartment for your money than in a lot of lower manhattan also a lot of the apartments seem much newer - proximity to central park i \u2019 m a runner - good bar/restaraunt scene from what i

out there when it's freezing cold to see apartments is no fun i work in real estate so i've used my experience plus the most recent advice posts on r/nycapartments to create this small q & a for people moving this winter : **first question most people ask -** where do i live which is the safest neighborhood where are the cheapest apartments - let's break down manhattan i've helped a lot of people move uptown so let's start there ; **neighborhoods** - fort george hamilton heights and morningside heights - harlem and washington heights are perfect for both newcomers and people that have been in new york city for years why would you move uptown you want more space you want to pay a cheaper rent you do n't mind a small commute but still want access to everything manhattan offers ~~average prices - studios $ 1800 1br $ 2000 2br $ 2500~~ **the upper west side** is very charming home to columbia university surrounded by parks a very quiet and residential neighborhood i've helped single professionals couples looking to start families settle here rent is more expensive and apartments are smaller when compared to harlem or washington heights ~~average prices - studios $ 2500 1br $ 3000 2br $ 3500~~ **the upper east side** is always a good option for new people moving into the city also people who want to live alone and pay a decently low rent the upper east side is an amazing neighborhood full of things to do with an easy commute to anywhere else downtown thanks to the q train ~~average prices - studios $ 2000 1br $ 2300 2br $ 2800~~ **midtown east and west** the most congested side of mahattan but also the most accessible for people that travel a ton or work in the tri-state area centrally located offers a ton of high-rises with competitive prices in the winter months west there is hell's kitchen a small residential neighborhood with a ton of nightlife to the east of the city kips bay and turtle bay two up and coming neighborhoods that are getting a lot attention for their competitive prices as well as the amazing amenities most buildings offer grand central nj transit lir and the metro north are very accessible from both the west and east side of midtown thanks to the 7 train ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 4000 2br $ 5000~~ **chelsea west and greenwich village** - the most iconic neighborhood in the city the village is the neighborhood where the dutch first settled in the island of manhattan the village is full of beautiful brownstones and pre-war architecture offers very limited and small inventory chelsea has been the most expensive neighborhood in manhattan since the opening of the highline park and now the recent addition of hudson yards yes those 3 huge new residential/commercial buildings added to the upper west side of chelsea we now call that hudson yards the newest neighborhood addition in manhattan ~~average prices - studios $ 4000 1br $ 5000 2br $ 6000~~ **gramercy flatiron noho and soho** amazing neighborhoods conveniently located in the center of manhattan union square is an iconic park and also the flatiron building both connected by broadway offers everything the city has easy commute anywhere in manhattan within 15 minutes ~~average prices - studios $ 2800 1br $ 3200 2br $ 3800~~ **stuytown east village and les** the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city if you want to live where the party is happening then you have found the right place i love the village super trendy and gentrified but also small and expensive surrounded by nightlife and everything else you need in life tends to be a top pick for nyu students ~~average prices - studios $ 2300 1br $ 2600 2br $ 3200~~ **tribeca and fidi** - not much going on down here a lot of commercial buildings turned to residential in the past years offering very competitive prices and very accessible living buildings tend to offer a ton of amenities but the neighborhood lacks on nightlife and other things path trains are super accessible and also brooklyn is 1 stop away in most subway lines ~~average prices - studios $ 3000 1br $ 3500 2br $ 4000~~ **** disclaimer** - obviously there is a ton i missed but here is a very small description of what's going on in manhattan also average prices yes you can find a lot lower prices in neighborhoods but please understand that this is n't a market analysis rental prices change seasonally and based on demand **must know - to qualify for an apartment in manhattan -** heads up **'' your income must be 40x the rent'' ** yes if you make 100k you can only live in a $ 2500 apartment what most people do is use a guarantor but **'' the guarantor must make 80x the rent'' ** ~~i know this sounds insane for most people moving into the city but it's the first requirement when searching for a place your income must be verified.~~ this turns a lot of people to rather search for a **room rental** rather than an apartment so now i'll share with you my thoughts on room sublets and finding a roommate since i am sure a ton of people will benefit from this here are the best ways to find a roommate ; **roomie app** - i found a ton of people when i was subletting my room i also found it very easy to communicate and i did n't have to pay anything to find people which is always good **spareroom** - this is also another great site very easy to use and i do n't think you have to pay a ton of friends have found roommates this way **facebook groups** - yes they work i have used gypsyhousing in fb to find my current roommates and i know a ton of people use it as well i do n't know any other groups but i am sure someone else will help us here **craigslist** - yes craigslist works i have found roommates and apartments on here but you have to know what you are doing as well as act very very fast things on craigslist go fast very fast i mean matter of minutes ~~***also there are a ton of scams on here which is why i said you have to know what you are doing when looking here~~ **so now that i have told you where to live and how to find a roomate i will tell you how to find an apartment definitely not the easiest but there is a formula a lot of people do n't want to deal with this so they hire a real estate agent i will not tell you what to do but rather explain both sides of the equation** **searching without an agent -** there is a only a few websites i will recommend because most are infested with outdated inventory and bait and switch ads **first** - streeteasy the most accurate and up-to-date availabilities in the rental and sales market agents pay a lot of money and streeteasy has a huge control over the nyc market so they make sure their ads are legit also - hotpads.com and nakedapartments.com **second** - google yes i know googling stuff works too so what you can do is try to put 1 and 2 together 1 use the address of a building you like to find the the management company or landlord online yes this is possible by doing a deeper search in nybits or popertyshark.com 2 contact them find a way to set up an appointment or ask how to get access to their vacancies **now here is a disclaimer some of the landlords and management companies might refer you to an agent which does n't make sense but it actually does this companies/landlords only want to work through agents it saves them the headache and time of dealing with uneducated prospect tenants ~~so after all your work you might find you actually have to talk to an agent anyways and or pay a fee but you might not.~~ that's when you know found gold you found a management company that will work with you and they will provide all the instructions on how to do so : **working with an agent -** this should be the easiest but can end up being a headache i get this a lot from the people i work with so here is the best way to find the right agent for you basically once you've narrow down your neighborhood preference find a few listings on streeteasy and reach out to the agents on the listing go see the apartments and ask a lot of questions to test the agents expertise and neighborhood knowledge before you leave ask the agents to email you other apartments that they have available i suggest you try this with 2 or 3 agents and only work with the one agent who is the most responsive and only shows you options that fit you best **pro tip** - seeing up to 8 apartments should help you make an informed decision on what your money's worth in the market after seeing 8 apartments you will begin to see them repeat and you realize that you are wasting your time **what is net effective rent ** net effective rent is the average monthly rent you pay during the term of a lease if a landlord is offering you a free month you \u2019 d still typically pay the higher gross rent every month except for the month which is free on average the amount you pay each month is the net effective rent asking rent : $ 7,791/month description : price is net effective with one month free on an 18 month lease *gross rent is $ 8,500 ****1/2 month free for every 6 months the tenants signs on for 18 months**** in this example you \u2019 d pay $ 8,500/month for 11 months and then $ 0 for the 12th month of the lease the average rent you \u2019 d pay during the lease term is $ 7,791/month otherwise known as the net effective rent **what is a fee listing and what is a no fee this helps you be upfront with the agent you decide to work with ** **fee** - fee listings should be deals if an agent is charging you a fee you should feel like it's worth paying it you should feel the agent is providing amazing service and the listing should be a deal for example i helped a novelist writer with no credit and no income get a $ 2500 studio in the west village everything about it was a deal the price the location the building and so she paid me a fee how did i find it through my relationship with the super in the building he tipped me that someone was moving out and i was able to get her in before anyone else again no credit or income so i had to use someone in her family as a guarantor double paperwork and so she paid me a fee she knew it was a deal she paid 15 % of the annual rent some agents have flexibility and can negotiate the fee yes you can get a reduced fee anywhere from 15 % to 10 % or close to a month which is around 8 % you can negotiate the broker's fee you should ask and the agent should not feel insulted **no fee** - no fee listings exist they are available if you are searching on any major website there should be a no fee filter so how come some agents can charge you a fee no fee apartments tends to be smaller in size they tend to be in great locations but tend to be higher rent be sure to ask the agent there is no brokers fee they will disclose it and how come there is no fee in most cases the landlord or management company pays the broker because they want to fill the vacancy this is a win win win **disclaimer the fee is added to your rent so no fee apartments are usually more expensive **deposit pet deposit and good faith deposit -** landlords should only take a 1 month deposit new housing laws recently past by the city now enforced everywhere landlords might want to still go around that so be aware condo's and co-op's sometimes have different rules but you can verify that with your agent again 1 month should be the only deposit you pay **pet deposit -** new housing laws prohibit landlords form taking pet deposits **condo's and co-op's might have different rules **good faith deposit -** a payment taken to show commitment this takes the listing off the market while you gather the supporting documentation needed the amount ranges from $ 500 to 1 month of rent yes this should move towards your first month of rent or security deposit ~~**you can lose this money only if you back out of the application process if you get denied this should be refunded to you.~~ **where do i find deals ** there is a ton of deals specially in the winter if you are looking to spend anything above 3k you can find amazing deals high-rise apartments no fee listings with amenities downtown manhattan below 3k you have look uptown uptown offers a lot more deals but lacks the amenities but you gain space and affordability i have found insane deals in craigslist also streeteasy allows you to be alerted when a deal comes up ~~i would suggest using that functionality as well as acting fast if you see something you like do not sleep on it because someone else will move on it first.~~ **list of supporting documents-** you should think about having in hand when hunting for apartments 1 2018 and 2017 tax returns 2 2 or 3 most recent pay stubs if you are employed 3 2 or 3 most recent checking/savings bank statements 4 state id or passport 5 employment letter with income displayed 6 letter from previous landlord 7 professional and personal references condo's and co-op's sometimes require them **if you are using a guarantor you will be required to provide the same list of supporting documents **last** although this information applies in all nyc i only offered information in manhattan neighborhoods because i only work and have lived in manhattan if you have any questions about brooklyn queens staten island or the bronx please feel free to dm me and i will refer you to someone that can help **thank you** for reading this and i hope this helps you land an amazing spot in the neighborhood you want also if you feel i missed something please feel free to add it on the comments i am sure there are a lot more tips other people have"]}
